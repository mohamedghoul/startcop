# QCB Regulatory AI Agent - Complete Project Documentation
## Business Problem & Objectives

### Business Problem Statement
The current process for pre-screening, evaluating compliance, and assessing the regulatory readiness of new Fintech startups is manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive for both the startups and the Qatar Central Bank (QCB). This lack of standardization leads to prolonged turnaround times and potential clarity issues, hindering the rapid growth of the Fintech ecosystem in Qatar.

**Goal:** Develop an AI-powered "Smart Digital Solution" to automate the initial vetting and readiness assessment of Fintech startups against QCB licensing requirements, thereby streamlining the process, reducing time-to-market, and providing clear regulatory guidance.

### Business Use Case (Detailed)
The solution must be an intelligent system capable of interpreting unstructured business documents (Business Plans, Operational Models, etc.) and transforming this data into structured compliance risk and readiness metrics.

### Key Technical Objectives

1. **AI Ingestion & Mapping:** Ingest and process complex, natural language documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX) to extract key business activities, services, and corporate structures. Map these extracted elements against a regulatory knowledge base (simulated QCB rule set) to determine relevant licensing requirements.

2. **Gap Analysis Engine:** Use the mapping to perform a comparison and identify specific deficiencies (missing policies, documentation, structural issues) against regulatory standards (e.g., AML, Consumer Protection, Corporate Governance).

3. **Readiness Scorecard Generation:** Calculate a weighted "Regulatory Readiness Scorecard" that quantifies the startup's current position and highlights high-risk gaps.

4. **Actionable Feedback Loop:** Generate clear, prescriptive advice and map specific needs (e.g., AML policy gap) to relevant external support services or QDB programs.

## Critical Constraints
- **ZERO BUDGET:** Everything must be completely free
- **LOCAL-ONLY:** No cloud servers, everything runs locally
- **AI MANDATORY:** Solution must involve AI (non-negotiable)
- **24-hour timeline:** Hackathon deadline
- **Data Residency:** Everything developed must run locally

Project Al-Ameen: Peer-to-Peer Investment Platform
Date: 2025-10-20 
Company Name: Al-Ameen Digital, LLC

Executive Summary
Al-Ameen Digital is launching a mobile-first Peer-to-Peer (P2P) investment platform targeting the SME and consumer market in Qatar. Our platform connects investors directly with borrowers, offering personalized loan terms and reducing reliance on traditional bank lending. We project originating QAR 50 million in loans in the first 12 months. Our core technology uses smart contracts for automated loan servicing.

1. Proposed Activities and Service Model
Our primary activities are:
P2P Loan Origination and Servicing: Facilitating debt contracts between users. Maximum individual transaction value for a loan is capped at QAR 200,000.
Cross-Border Remittances: We offer an optional service for international investors to remit funds into Qatari accounts, leveraging a partnership with a third-party global payment processor, 'SwiftPay Global'. This service involves transferring funds up to QAR 45,000 per transaction.
Digital Wallet: A proprietary, non-interest-bearing digital wallet where users hold funds before deployment or after repayment.

2. Corporate and Operational Structure
The company is structured as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) registered in Qatar. Our management team includes a CEO, CTO, and Head of Finance. Our current focus is on technology development and marketing. We plan to hire a dedicated data scientist next quarter.

3. Technology and Data Storage
Our platform is hosted entirely on a globally distributed Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure, utilizing server resources in Ireland and Singapore for maximum resilience and disaster recovery. We utilize industry-standard 256-bit encryption for all data transit and storage. We will obtain customer consent for using their data to improve our proprietary credit scoring algorithm.

4. Current Compliance and Governance Plan
We have drafted a Data Privacy Policy and a basic KYC Procedure which involves capturing a national ID card via the app. For all users, we require a utility bill as proof of address. We do not currently have a dedicated Compliance Officer but plan to assign these duties to the Head of Finance until we secure Series A funding. Our policy for reporting suspicious transactions is currently under review by our external legal counsel.
