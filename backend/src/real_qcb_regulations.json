Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nPreliminary Part 1.1\nRule 1.1.1\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.1 Preliminary\n1.1.1 Introduction\n(1) These rules are the Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 (or\nBANK).\n(2) These rules establish the prudential framework for banking business\nfirms. They are based on the Basel Accords and the Basel Core\nPrinciples for Effective Banking Supervision issued by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision.\nNote The Basel Committee is the primary global standard-setter for the prudential\nregulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking\nsupervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision\nand practices of banks and regulators worldwide and thereby enhance\nfinancial stability.\n1.1.2 Commencement\nThese rules commence on 1 January 2015.\n1.1.3 Effect of definitions, notes and examples\n(1) A definition in the glossary to these rules also applies to any instructions\nor document made under these rules.\n(2) A note in or to these rules is explanatory and is not part of these rules.\nHowever, examples and guidance are part of these rules.\n(3) An example is not exhaustive, and may extend, but does not limit, the\nmeaning of these rules or the particular provision of these rules to which\nit relates.\nNote Under FSR, art 17 (4), guidance is indicative of the view of the Regulatory\nAuthority at the time and in the circumstances in which it was given.\n1.1.3A References to particular currencies\nIn these rules, the specification of an amount of money in a particular\ncurrency is also taken to specify the equivalent sum in any other\ncurrency at the relevant time.\n1.1.4 Application of these rules—general\nExcept as stated otherwise, these rules apply to an entity that has, or is\napplying for, an authorisation to conduct banking business.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 1\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.1 Preliminary\nRule 1.1.5\nGuidance\n1 These rules apply to a banking business firm regardless of whether the firm\nconducts other regulated activities—see rules 1.3.2 (2) and 1.3.3 (2). The\nfollowing Rules also apply to such a firm:\n• if the Investment Management and Advisory Rules 2014 (INMA) also\napplies to it—those Rules\n• in relation to its dealings with customers—CIPR.\nRules that are of general application also apply (for example, CTRL and Anti-\nMoney Laundering and Combating Terrorist Financing Rules 2010).\n2 It is possible for a firm both to be authorised as a banking business firm under\nthese rules (that is, as a deposit-taker or an investment dealer) and to hold an\nauthorisation under INMA. Both these rules and INMA would apply to such a\nfirm to some degree. In relation to such a firm, however, the capital requirements\nin these rules apply. If that firm complies with the capital requirements in these\nrules, it is taken to comply with the minimum capital and liquid assets\nrequirements in INMA—see INMA, rule 3.3.1 (2).\n1.1.5 Application of these rules—branches\n(1) Chapter 3 (capital adequacy and capital requirements) does not apply to\na banking business firm that is a branch insofar as that chapter would\nrequire the branch to hold capital.\n(2) However, the Regulatory Authority may require a branch to have capital\nresources or to comply with any other capital requirement if the\nauthority considers it necessary or desirable to do so in the interest of\neffective supervision of the branch.\n1.1.6 Requirement for policy also requires procedures and\nsystems\nIn these rules, a requirement for a banking business firm to have a policy\nalso requires such a firm to have the procedures, systems, processes,\ncontrols and limits needed to give effect to the policy.\n1.1.7 Responsibility for principles\n(1) A banking business firm’s governing body is responsible for the firm’s\ncompliance with the principles and requirements set out in these rules.\n(2) The governing body must ensure that the firm’s senior management\nestablishes and implements policies to give effect to these rules. The\ngoverning body must approve significant policies and any changes to\nthem (other than formal changes) and must ensure that the policies are\nfully integrated with each other.\nNote 1 The significant policies relate to the adequacy of capital and the\nmanagement of prudential risk and group risk, as set out in the following\nChapters.\npage 2 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nPreliminary Part 1.1\nRule 1.1.8\nNote 2 For the requirements for an authorised firm’s general risk management\nstrategy—see CTRL.\n(3) The governing body must review the firm’s significant policies from\ntime to time, taking into account changed operating circumstances,\nactivities and risks. The interval between reviews must be appropriate\nfor the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s business, but must not\nbe longer than 12 months.\n(4) The governing body must ensure that the policies are made known to,\nand understood by, all relevant staff.\n1.1.8 Evaluation of information given to firm\nA banking business firm’s governing body must evaluate the suitability\nand effectiveness of the information and reports that it and the firm’s\nsenior management receive under these rules. The test of suitability and\neffectiveness is whether the information and reports are suitable for\neffectively overseeing and implementing the principles and\nrequirements set out in these rules.\n1.1.9 Stress-testing\nIn carrying out stress-testing and developing its stress-testing scenarios,\na banking business firm must consider the Basel Committee’s\nrecommended standards for stress-testing.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 3\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.2 Principles relating to banking business\nRule 1.2.1\nPart 1.2 Principles relating to banking\nbusiness\n1.2.1 Principle 1—capital adequacy\nA banking business firm must have capital, of adequate amount and\nappropriate quality, for the nature, scale and complexity of its business\nand for its risk profile.\n1.2.2 Principle 2—credit risk and problem assets\n(1) A banking business firm must have an adequate credit risk management\npolicy that takes into account the firm’s risk appetite, its risk profile and\nthe market and macroeconomic conditions.\n(2) The firm must have adequate policies for the early identification and\nmanagement of problem assets, and the maintenance of adequate\nprovisions and reserves.\n1.2.3 Principle 3—transactions with related parties\nA banking business firm must enter into transactions with related parties\non an arm’s-length basis in order to avoid conflicts of interest.\n1.2.4 Principle 4—concentration risk\nA banking business firm must have adequate policies to identify,\nmeasure, evaluate, manage and control or mitigate concentrations of risk\nin a timely way.\n1.2.5 Principle 5—market risk\nA banking business firm must have an adequate market risk\nmanagement policy that takes into account the firm’s risk appetite, its\nrisk profile, the market and macroeconomic conditions and the risk of a\nsignificant deterioration in market liquidity. The firm must have\nadequate policies to identify, measure, evaluate, manage and control or\nmitigate market risk in a timely way.\n1.2.6 Principle 6—operational risk and operational resilience\nA banking business firm must have an adequate operational risk\nmanagement framework and approach to operational resilience that\ntakes into account the firm’s risk appetite, risk profile, tolerance for\ndisruption to its critical operations, emerging risks and market and\nmacroeconomic conditions.\npage 4 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nPrinciples relating to banking business Part 1.2\nRule 1.2.7\n1.2.7 Principle 7— interest rate risk in the banking book\nA banking business firm must have an adequate management policy for\ninterest rate risk in the banking book that takes into account the firm’s\nrisk appetite, its risk profile and the market and macroeconomic\nconditions. The firm must have policies to identify, measure, evaluate,\nmanage and control or mitigate interest rate risk in the banking book on\na timely basis.\n1.2.8 Principle 8—liquidity risk\nA banking business firm must have prudent and appropriate quantitative\nand qualitative liquidity requirements. The firm must have policies that\nenable the firm to comply with those requirements and to manage\nliquidity risk prudently.\n1.2.9 Principle 9—group risk\nA banking business firm must effectively manage risks arising from its\nmembership in a group.\nNote For the governing body’s responsibilities relating to:\n• capital adequacy—see rule 3.1.3\n• credit risk and problem assets—see rule 4.1.4\n• transactions with related parties—see rule 4.8.4\n• concentration risk—see rule 5.1.4\n• market risk—see rule 6.1.5\n• operational risk—see CTRL Part 8.2\n• IRRBB—see rule 8.1.4\n• liquidity risk—see rule 9.1.5\n• group risk—see rule 10.1.4.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 5\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.3 Banking business firms\nRule 1.3.1\nPart 1.3 Banking business firms\n1.3.1 Introduction\n(1) Banking business comprises the activities of deposit taking, providing\ncredit facilities and dealing in investments as principal. An authorised\nfirm that has an authorisation to conduct any of those activities is a\nbanking business firm.\n(2) However, an authorised firm that is an Islamic bank or Islamic\ninvestment dealer (within the respective meanings of the Islamic\nBanking Business Prudential Rules 2015) is not a banking business\nfirm.\nNote An authorised firm that is an Islamic bank or Islamic investment dealer is an\nIslamic banking business firm—see the Islamic Banking Business\nPrudential Rules 2015.\n(3) A banking business firm may be a deposit-taker or an investment dealer.\nGuidance\nA firm that conducts any of the activities that make up banking business, or a\ncombination of those activities, will need to consider the extent to which its business\nmodel is subject to the prudential requirements set out in these rules. These rules are\ndesigned to address the different prudential risks that could arise from the broad range\nof business models, risk appetites and risk profiles of banking business firms.\nFor example, a firm that solely conducts the activity of dealing in investments as\nprincipal (that is, an investment dealer) will need to consider the extent to which its\nactivities in buying, selling, subscribing to or underwriting investments attract\nprudential risks that are subject to the requirements of these rules. In contrast, a firm\nthat is a deposit-taker and that also deals in investments as principal would be subject\nto a broader range of prudential requirements. In both examples, these rules apply in\naccordance with the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s business.\n1.3.2 Deposit-taker\n(1) An authorised firm is a deposit-taker if it is authorised to conduct either\nor both of the regulated activities of deposit taking and providing credit\nfacilities.\n(2) A firm is a deposit-taker even if it is also authorised to conduct any other\nregulated activity or activity. The authorisation for deposit taking or\nproviding credit facilities makes the firm a deposit-taker.\n1.3.3 Investment dealer\n(1) An authorised firm is an investment dealer if:\n(a) it is authorised to conduct the regulated activity of dealing in\ninvestments as principal; and\n(b) it is not a deposit-taker.\npage 6 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nBanking business firms Part 1.3\nRule 1.3.3\n(2) A firm is an investment dealer even if it is also authorised to conduct\nany other regulated activity (except deposit taking and providing credit\nfacilities). The authorisation for dealing in investments (and the absence\nof an authorisation that would make it a deposit-taker) makes the firm\nan investment dealer.\n1.3.5 Legal form that firms must take\n(1) A deposit-taker must be:\n(a) a limited liability company incorporated under the Companies\nRegulations 2005; or\n(b) a branch registered with the QFC Companies Registration Office.\n(2) An investment dealer must be:\n(a) a limited liability company incorporated under the Companies\nRegulations 2005;\n(b) a branch registered with the QFC Companies Registration Office;\nor\n(c) a limited liability partnership incorporated under the Limited\nLiability Partnerships Regulations 2005.\nNote Branch is defined in the glossary.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 7\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 2 Prudential reporting requirements\nRule 2.1.1\nChapter 2 Prudential reporting\nrequirements\n2.1.1 Introduction\n(1) This Chapter sets out the prudential reporting requirements for a\nbanking business firm.\n(2) Prudential returns of a banking business firm must reflect the firm’s\nmanagement accounts, financial statements and ancillary reports. A\nfirm’s returns, accounts, statements and reports must all be prepared\nusing the same standards and practices, and must be easily reconcilable\nwith one another.\n(3) A return is referred to as a solo return if it reflects 1 firm’s accounts,\nstatements and reports.\n(4) A consolidated return deals with the accounts, statements and reports\nof a firm consolidated with those of the other members of its financial\ngroup.\nNote Financial group is defined in rule 10.1.2 (2) and is used for consolidated\nreporting instead of ‘corporate group’.\n2.1.2 Information about financial group\nIf directed by the Regulatory Authority, a banking business firm must\ngive the authority the following information about its financial group:\n(a) details about the entities in the group;\n(b) the structure of the group;\n(c) how the group is managed;\n(d) any other information that the authority requires.\n2.1.3 Financial group and prudential risk\n(1) If a banking business firm is part of a financial group, credit risk, market\nrisk, operational risk, IRRBB and liquidity risk (collectively referred to\nas prudential risk) apply on a consolidated basis to the firm and the\nother members that make up the financial group.\n(2) Done on a consolidated basis means done not just to include the\nfinancial activities or items of the firm but those of the other members\nof its financial group as well.\nNote A banking business firm must have systems to enable it to calculate its\nfinancial group capital requirement and resources—see rule 10.1.3 (3). The\nfirm must ensure that its financial group capital resources exceed its\nfinancial group capital requirement—see rule 10.2.2 (1).\npage 8 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nPrudential reporting requirements Chapter 2\nRule 2.1.4\n2.1.4 Preparing returns\n(1) A banking business firm must prepare the prudential returns that it is\nrequired to prepare by notice published by the Regulatory Authority on\nan approved website. Such a notice may also require banking business\nfirms to give other information to the authority.\n(2) The firm must give the return to the Regulatory Authority within the\nperiod stated in the notice.\n(3) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice:\n(a) require a firm to prepare additional prudential returns;\n(b) exempt a firm from a requirement to prepare annual, biannual,\nquarterly or monthly returns (or a particular return); or\n(c) extend the period within which to give a return.\n(4) An exemption may be subject to 1 or more conditions. The firm must\ncomply with any condition attached to an exemption.\n(5) The firm must prepare and give prudential returns in accordance with\nthe Regulatory Authority’s instructions. The instructions may require\nthat the return be prepared or given through the authority’s electronic\nsubmission system.\n(6) The instructions may be set out in these rules, in the return itself, in a\nseparate document published by the authority on an approved website\nor by written notice. These instructions, wherever or however they are\ngiven, are collectively referred to as instructions for preparing returns.\nNote Instructions may be in the form of formulae or blank spaces that the firm\nmust use or fill in and that automatically compute the amounts to be\nreported.\n2.1.5 Giving information\n(1) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice, require a banking\nbusiness firm to give it information additional to that required under\nthese rules.\n(2) A banking business firm must give information to the Regulatory\nAuthority in accordance with the authority’s instructions and within the\nperiod stated in the notice. The authority may extend the period within\nwhich to give the information.\n(3) The Regulatory Authority may exempt a banking business firm from\ngiving information. The firm must comply with any condition attached\nto an exemption.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 2 Prudential reporting requirements\nRule 2.1.6\n2.1.6 Accounts and statements to use international standards\n(1) A banking business firm must prepare and keep its financial accounts\nand statements in accordance with IFRS, US GAAP or other accounting\nstandards approved in writing by the Regulatory Authority.\n(2) If the firm decides to prepare and keep its financial accounts and\nstatements in accordance with a standard other than the one it has\npreviously used, it must notify the authority in writing before beginning\nto do so.\n2.1.7 Signing returns\n(1) A prudential return must be signed by 2 individuals.\n(2) If the individuals approved to exercise the finance function and the\nsenior executive function for the firm are available, they must sign the\nreturn. If either or both of those individuals is or are unable to sign, the\nreturn must be signed by 1 or 2 of the individuals approved to exercise\nthe following functions:\n(a) the risk management function;\n(b) the compliance oversight function;\n(c) the executive governance function.\n(3) In subrule (2), finance function, senior executive function, risk\nmanagement function, compliance oversight function and executive\ngovernance function mean the functions described in CTRL, Division\n1.2.B.\n2.1.8 Firm to notify authority\n(1) A banking business firm must notify the Regulatory Authority if it\nbecomes aware, or has reasonable grounds to believe, that the firm has\nbreached, or is about to breach, a prudential requirement.\n(2) In particular, the firm must notify the authority as soon as practicable\nof:\n(a) any breach (or foreseen breach) of its minimum capital\nrequirement;\n(b) any concern (including because of projected losses) it has about its\ncapital adequacy;\n(c) any indication of significant adverse change in the market pricing\nof, or trading in, the capital instruments of the firm or its financial\ngroup (including pressure on the firm to purchase its own equity\nor debt);\n(d) any other significant adverse change in its capital; and\npage 10 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nPrudential reporting requirements Chapter 2\nRule 2.1.8\n(e) any significant departure from its ICAAP.\nNote For a banking business firm’s ICAAP—see rule 3.1.5.\n(3) The firm must also notify the authority of any measures taken or planned\nto deal with any breach, prospective breach or concern.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.1 General\nRule 3.1.1\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.1 General\n3.1.1 Introduction\n(1) This Chapter sets out capital adequacy requirements.\n(2) A banking business firm’s total regulatory capital is the sum of its tier 1\ncapital and tier 2 capital. The categories and elements of regulatory\ncapital, as well as the limits, restrictions and adjustments to which they\nare subject are set out in this Chapter.\n(3) Capital supports the firm’s operation by providing a buffer to absorb\nlosses from its activities and, in the event of problems, it enables the\nfirm to continue to operate in a sound and viable manner while the\nproblems are resolved. Capital management must be an integral part of\na banking business firm’s credit risk management process and must\nalign the firm’s risk appetite and risk profile with its capacity to absorb\nlosses.\nNote For the governing body’s responsibilities in relation to capital management\nand capital adequacy—see rule 3.1.3 (2).\n3.1.2 Chapter 3 and its application to branches\n(1) This chapter does not apply to a banking business firm that is a branch\ninsofar as this chapter would require the branch to hold capital.\n(2) A branch is required to comply with the reporting requirements under\nthis chapter. In relation to the branch’s ICAAP, the branch may rely on\nthe head office’s ICAAP (if available) to demonstrate compliance.\n3.1.3 Governing body’s responsibilities\n(1) A banking business firm’s governing body must consider whether the\nminimum financial resources required by these rules are adequate to\nensure that there is no significant risk that the firm’s liabilities cannot\nbe met as they fall due. The firm must obtain additional financial\nresources if its governing body considers that the minimum required\ndoes not adequately reflect the risks of its business.\n(2) The governing body is also responsible for:\n(a) ensuring that capital management is part of the firm’s overall risk\nmanagement and is aligned with its risk appetite and risk profile;\n(b) ensuring that the firm has, at all times, financial resources of the\nkinds and amounts required by these rules;\npage 12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nGeneral Part 3.1\nRule 3.1.4\nNote Financial resources is a broader concept than capital resources.\nFinancial resources could include liquid assets (such as cash in hand),\nirrevocable lines of credit and irrevocable guarantees.\n(c) ensuring that the firm has capital, of adequate amount and\nappropriate quality, for the nature, scale and complexity of its\nbusiness and for its risk profile;\n(d) ensuring that the amount of capital it has exceeds its minimum\ncapital requirement;\n(e) monitoring the adequacy and appropriateness of the firm’s systems\nand controls and the firm’s compliance with them; and\n(f) approving the firm’s ICAAP and any significant changes to it.\nGuidance\n2 If the firm is a member of a financial group, the authority expects the capital of\nthe financial group to be apportioned among the group’s members, based on the\nallocation of risks between them.\n3.1.4 Systems and controls\n(1) A banking business firm must have adequate systems and controls to\nallow it to calculate and monitor its minimum capital requirement.\n(2) The systems and controls must be in writing and must be appropriate\nfor the nature, scale and complexity of its business and for its risk\nprofile.\n(3) The systems and controls must enable the firm to show at all times\nwhether it complies with this Chapter.\n(4) The systems and controls must enable the firm to manage available\ncapital in anticipation of events or changes in market conditions.\n(5) The systems and controls must include ICAAP, and the firm must have\ncontingency arrangements to maintain or increase its capital in times of\nstress.\n3.1.5 Internal capital adequacy assessment\n(1) A banking business firm’s internal capital adequacy assessment\nprocess or ICAAP is the process by which the firm continuously\ndemonstrates that it has implemented methods and procedures to ensure\nthat it has adequate capital resources to support the nature and level of\nits risks.\n(2) A firm’s ICAAP (and any significant changes to it) must be in writing\nand must have been approved by the firm’s governing body.

The embedded derivative associated with the\nhost should be bifurcated and separately recognised on the firm’s balance sheet.\nThis means that the firm should split the liability into two components:\n• the embedded derivative, which is assigned to the trading book\n• the residual liability, which is retained in the banking book.\nNo internal risk transfers are necessary for the bifurcation. If such a liability is\nunwound, or an embedded option is exercised, both the trading and banking\nbook components are conceptually unwound simultaneously and instantly\nretired; no transfers between trading and banking book are necessary.\n(4) The following instruments must be held in the trading book, unless a\nrule specifically provides otherwise:\n(a) instruments in the firm’s correlation trading portfolio (see subrules\n(5) to (7));\n(b) instruments that would give rise to a net short credit or equity\nposition in the banking book;\nGuidance\nThe firm will have a net short risk position for equity risk or credit risk in the\nbanking book if the present value of the banking book increases when an equity\nprice decreases or when a credit spread on an issuer or group of issuers of debt\nincreases.\n(c) instruments resulting from securities underwriting commitments.\n(5) A banking business firm’s correlation trading portfolio comprises the\nfirm’s holdings of securitisation exposures and nth-to-default credit\nderivatives that meet the following criteria:\n(a) the positions are neither of the following:\n(i) re-securitisation positions;\n(ii) derivatives of securitisation exposures that do not provide a\npro-rata share in the proceeds of a securitisation tranche;\nGuidance\nTherefore, options on a securitisation tranche, or a synthetically leveraged\nsuper-senior tranche, are excluded.\n(b) all the reference obligations are single-name products (including\nsingle-name credit derivatives) for which there is a liquid two-way\nmarket (see subrule (8)).\nGuidance\nThe instruments referred to in paragraph (b) include commonly traded indices\nbased on such reference obligations.\npage 18 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nBoundary between banking book and trading book Part 3.1A\nRule 3.1A.7\n(6) A banking business firm may also include, in the correlation trading\nportfolio, positions:\n(a) that hedge positions described in subrule (5);

The firm’s capital adequacy ratios (consisting of CET\n1 ratio, total tier 1 ratio and total capital ratio) are calculated by dividing\nits regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets.\n(2) Total risk-weighted assets of a banking business firm is the sum of:\n(a) the firm’s risk-weighted on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet\nitems calculated in accordance with Part 4.4; and\n(b) 12.5 times the sum of the firm’s market and operational risk capital\nrequirements (to the extent that each of those requirements applies\nto the firm).\nNote For how to calculate the firm’s market risk and operational risk capital\nrequirements, see rule 6.1.1 (3) and Part 7.4, respectively.\n(3) In this Part:\nconsolidated subsidiary, of a banking business firm, means:\n(a) a subsidiary of the firm; or\n(b) a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the firm.\n3.2.2 Required tier 1 capital on authorisation\nAn entity must have, at the time it is authorised, tier 1 capital at least\nequal to the base capital requirement for the activity applied for. The\nRegulatory Authority will not grant an authorisation unless it is satisfied\nthat the entity complies with this requirement.\n3.2.3 Required ongoing capital\n(1) A banking business firm must have at all times capital at least equal to\nthe higher of:\n(a) its base capital requirement; and\n(b) its risk-based capital requirement.\nNote A firm whose minimum capital requirement is its risk-based capital\nrequirement is subject to the additional requirement to maintain a\ncapital conservation buffer—see rule 3.3.2.\n(2) The amount of capital that a firm must have is its minimum capital\nrequirement.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 25\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.2 Initial and ongoing capital requirements\nRule 3.2.4\n3.2.4 Base capital requirement\nThe base capital requirement for a banking business firm is:\n(a) for a deposit-taker—QR 35 million; or\n(b) for an investment dealer—QR7 million.\n3.2.5 Risk-based capital requirement\nThe risk-based capital requirement for a banking business firm is the\nsum of:\n(a) its credit risk capital requirement;\n(b) its market risk capital requirement; and\n(c) its operational risk capital requirement.\n3.2.6 Capital adequacy ratios\n(1) A banking business firm’s capital adequacy is measured against\n3 capital ratios expressed as percentages of its total risk-weighted assets.\n(2) A firm’s minimum capital adequacy ratios are:\n(a) a CET 1 capital ratio of 4.5%;\n(b) a tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; and\n(c) a regulatory capital ratio of 8%.\nNote Under rule 3.3.2, at least 2.5% (by way of a capital conservation buffer)\nmust be held by a banking business firm in addition to the minimum capital\nadequacy ratios. The firm’s CET 1 capital plus capital conservation buffer\nmust therefore be no less than 7% of its total risk-weighted assets.\n(3) The Regulatory Authority may, if it believes it is prudent to do so,\nincrease any or all of a firm’s minimum capital adequacy ratios. The\nauthority will notify the firm in writing about a new capital adequacy\nratio and the timeframe for meeting it.\n(4) A firm must maintain at all times capital adequacy ratios higher than the\nrequired minimum so that adequate capital is maintained in the context\nof the firm’s risk appetite, risk profile and capital requirements, and as\nan additional buffer to absorb losses and problems from market\nvolatility. These higher ratios are the firm’s risk-based capital adequacy\nratios.\nDivision 3.2.B Elements of regulatory capital\n3.2.7 Regulatory capital\n(1) The regulatory capital of a firm is the sum of its tier 1 capital and tier 2\ncapital.\npage 26 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nInitial and ongoing capital requirements Part 3.2\nRule 3.2.8\n(2) Tier 1 capital is the sum of a firm’s CET 1 capital and additional tier 1\ncapital. Tier 1 capital is also known as going-concern capital because it\nis meant to absorb losses while the firm is viable.\nNote For the elements of CET 1 capital and additional tier 1 capital—see\nrules 3.2.8 and 3.2.10.\n(3) Tier 2 capital is the sum of the elements set out in rule 3.2.12. Tier 2\ncapital is also known as gone-concern capital because it is meant to\nabsorb losses after the firm ceases to be viable.\n(4) For these rules, the 3 categories of regulatory capital are CET 1 capital,\nadditional tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital.\n3.2.8 Common equity tier 1 capital\nCommon equity tier 1 capital (or CET 1 capital) is the sum of the\nfollowing elements:\n(a) common shares issued by a banking business firm that satisfy the\ncriteria in rule 3.2.9 for classification as common shares (or the\nequivalent for non-joint stock companies);\n(b) share premium resulting from the issue of instruments included in\nCET 1 capital;\nNote Share premium is also known as stock surplus and constitutes\nadditional paid-in capital.\n(c) retained earnings;\n(d) accumulated other comprehensive income and other disclosed\nreserves (for example, the foreign currency translation reserve\nmentioned in rule 6.2.2 (4));\n(e) common shares, issued by a consolidated subsidiary of the firm\nand held by third parties, that satisfy the criteria in rule 3.2.16 for\ninclusion in CET 1 capital;\n(f) regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of CET 1 capital\nin accordance with Division 3.2.D.\nNote Retained earnings and other comprehensive income include appropriated\nprofit or loss.\n3.2.9 Criteria for classification as common shares\n(1) An instrument issued by a banking business firm is classified as a\ncommon share and included in CET 1 capital if all of the criteria in\nsubrules (2) to (15) are satisfied.\n(2) The instrument is the most subordinated claim in case of the liquidation\nof the firm.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 27\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.2 Initial and ongoing capital requirements\nRule 3.2.9\n(3) The holder of the instrument is entitled to a claim on the residual assets\nthat is proportional to its share of issued capital, after all senior claims\nhave been repaid in liquidation. The claim must be unlimited and\nvariable and must be neither fixed nor capped.\n(4) The principal amount of the instrument is perpetual and never repayable\nexcept in liquidation. Discretionary repurchases and other discretionary\nmeans of reducing capital allowed by law do not constitute repayment.\nNote Under rule 3.3.6, the Regulatory Authority’s approval is required for a\nreduction in capital.\n(5) The firm does nothing to create an expectation at issuance that the\ninstrument will be bought back, redeemed or cancelled. The statutory or\ncontractual terms do not provide anything that might give rise to such\nan expectation.\n(6) Distributions are paid out of distributable items of the firm (including\nretained earnings) and the amount of distributions:\n(a) is not tied or linked to the amount paid in at issuance; and\n(b) is not subject to a contractual cap (except to the extent that a firm\nmay not pay distributions that exceed the amount of its\ndistributable items).\n(7) There are no circumstances under which the distributions are obligatory.\nNon-payment of distributions does not constitute default.\n(8) Distributions are paid only after all legal and contractual obligations\nhave been met and payments on more senior capital instruments have\nbeen made. There are no preferential distributions and in particular none\nfor any other elements classified as the highest quality issued capital.\n(9) It is the issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest\nshare of any losses as they occur. Within the highest quality capital, each\ninstrument absorbs losses on a going-concern basis proportionately and\nequally with all the others.\nNote This criterion is taken to be satisfied even if the instrument includes a\npermanent write-down mechanism.\n(10) The paid-in amount is recognised as equity capital (rather than as a\nliability) for determining balance-sheet insolvency.\n(11) The paid-in amount is classified as equity in accordance with the\nrelevant accounting standards.\nNote For the firm’s choice and use of accounting standards—see rule 2.1.6.\n(12) The instrument is directly issued and paid-in, and the firm has not\ndirectly or indirectly funded the purchase of the instrument.\npage 28 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nInitial and ongoing capital requirements Part 3.2\nRule 3.2.10\n(13) The paid-in amount is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the\nfirm or a related party, nor subject to any other arrangement that legally\nor economically enhances the seniority of the holder’s claim in relation\nto the claims of the firm’s creditors.\n(14) The instrument is issued only with the approval of the owners of the\nfirm, either given directly by the owners or, if permitted by the\napplicable law, given by its governing body or by other persons\nauthorised by the owners.\n(15) The instrument is clearly and separately disclosed on the firm’s balance\nsheet.\n3.2.10 Additional tier 1 capital\nAdditional tier 1 capital is the sum of the following elements:\n(a) instruments issued by a banking business firm that satisfy the\ncriteria in rule 3.2.11 for inclusion in additional tier 1 capital (and\nare not included in CET 1 capital);\n(b) share premium resulting from the issue of instruments included in\nadditional tier 1 capital;\nNote Share premium is also known as stock surplus and constitutes\nadditional paid-in capital.\n(c) instruments, issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the firm and\nheld by third parties, that satisfy the criteria in rule 3.2.17 for\ninclusion in additional tier 1 capital (and are not included in CET 1\ncapital);\n(d) regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of additional\ntier 1 capital in accordance with Division 3.2.D.\n3.2.11 Criteria for inclusion in additional tier 1 capital\n(1) An instrument is included in additional tier 1 capital if all of the criteria\nin subrules (2) to (16) are satisfied.\n(2) The instrument is paid-in.\n(3) The instrument is the most subordinated claim after those of depositors,\ngeneral creditors and holders of the subordinated debt of the firm.\n(4) The paid-in amount is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the\nfirm or a related party, nor subject to any other arrangement that legally\nor economically enhances the seniority of the holder’s claim in relation\nto the claims of the firm’s creditors.\n(5) The instrument is perpetual.

Adjustments may also be required in relation to assets that\ncannot readily be converted into cash.\nGuidance\nAdjustments may be required to any of the 3 categories of regulatory capital, but most\nof them apply to CET 1 capital.\n3.2.21 Approach to valuation for regulatory adjustment\nA banking business firm must use the same approach for valuing\nregulatory adjustments to its capital as it does for balance-sheet\nvaluations. An item that is deducted from capital must be valued in the\nsame way as it would be for inclusion in the firm’s balance sheet.\n3.2.22 Meaning of investment for Division 3.2.D\nIn this Division:\ninvestment by a banking business firm in an entity includes any direct,\nindirect or synthetic holding of capital instruments issued by the entity\npage 36 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nInitial and ongoing capital requirements Part 3.2\nRule 3.2.23\n(and in particular includes an indirect holding that results from the\nholding of an index security).\n3.2.23 How adjustments are to be made\nA regulatory adjustment to a banking business firm’s regulatory capital\nmay be either a deduction from that capital or the derecognition of an\nitem for the calculation of the capital.\n3.2.24 Corresponding deduction approach\nIf this Division requires a deduction to be made using the corresponding\ndeduction approach, a banking business firm must make the deduction\nfrom the category of regulatory capital that the holding would qualify\nas if the firm itself had issued the relevant instrument (or, if the firm\ndoes not have sufficient regulatory capital in that category, from the next\nhigher category). For that purpose, CET 1 capital is the highest category\nof regulatory capital, additional tier 1 capital is the next highest, and tier\n2 is the lowest.\nNote For these rules, the 3 categories of regulatory capital are CET 1 capital,\nadditional tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital — see rule 3.2.7 (4).\n3.2.25 Goodwill and intangible assets\nA banking business firm must deduct, from its CET 1 capital, the\namount of its goodwill and other intangible assets (except mortgage\nservicing rights). The amount must be net of any related deferred tax\nliability that would be extinguished if the goodwill or assets become\nimpaired or derecognised under IFRS or any other relevant accounting\nstandards.\nNote For the treatment of mortgage servicing rights, see rule 3.2.36.\n3.2.26 Deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability\n(1) This rule applies to deferred tax assets of a banking business firm if the\nassets depend on the future profitability of the firm to be realised, but\ndoes not apply to such assets that relate to temporary differences.\n(2) For each deferred tax asset to which this rule applies, the firm must\ndeduct, from its CET 1 capital, the full amount of the asset net of any\ndeferred tax liability that may be netted against it under subrules (3) to\n(5).\n(3) A deferred tax asset may be netted against a deferred tax liability only\nif:\n(a) the asset and the liability relate to taxes levied by the same taxation\nauthority; and\n(b) that authority explicitly permits offsetting.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 37\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.2 Initial and ongoing capital requirements\nRule 3.2.27\n(4) A deferred tax liability must not be used for netting if it has already been\nnetted against a deduction of goodwill or other intangible assets, or\ndefined benefit pension assets.\n(5) A deferred tax liability that may be netted must be allocated pro rata\nbetween deferred tax assets deducted under this rule and those to which\nthe treatment in rule 3.2.36 is applied.\n3.2.27 Cash flow hedge reserve\nIn the calculation of its CET 1 capital, a banking business firm must\nderecognise the amount of the cash flow hedge reserve that relates to\nthe hedging of items that are not fair valued on the balance sheet\n(including projected cash flows).\n3.2.28 Increases in provisioning\nIf the Regulatory Authority has directed a banking business firm to\napply rule 4.7.27 (prescribed provisioning), and the result is to increase\nthe firm’s provisions for credit losses, the firm must deduct, from its\nCET 1 capital, the amount of the increase in those provisions.\n3.2.29 Gains on sale from securitisations\nIn the calculation of its CET 1 capital, a banking business firm must\nderecognise any increase in equity capital or CET 1 capital from a\nsecuritisation or resecuritisation transaction (for example, an increase\nassociated with expected future margin income resulting in a gain-on-\nsale).\n3.2.30 Gains and losses from changes to own credit risk\n(1) In the calculation of a banking business firm’s CET 1 capital:\n(a) the firm must derecognise all unrealised gains and unrealised\nlosses that have resulted from changes in the fair value of liabilities\nbecause of changes in the firm’s own credit risk; and\n(b) in relation to derivative liabilities, the firm must derecognise all\naccounting valuation adjustments that arise from the firm’s own\ncredit risk.\n(2) The firm must not offset valuation adjustments that arise from the firm’s\nown credit risk against such adjustments that arise from its\ncounterparties’ credit risk.\n3.2.31 Defined benefit pension fund assets\n(1) A banking business firm must deduct, from its CET 1 capital, the\namount of a defined benefit pension fund that is an asset on the firm’s\nbalance sheet. The amount must be net of any related deferred tax\npage 38 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nInitial and ongoing capital requirements Part 3.2\nRule 3.2.32\nliability that would be extinguished if the asset were to become impaired\nor derecognised under IFRS or any other relevant accounting standards.\n(2) The firm may apply to the Regulatory Authority for approval to offset\nfrom the deduction any asset in the fund to which the firm has\nunrestricted and unfettered access. Such an asset must be assigned the\nrisk-weight that would be assigned to it if it were owned directly by the\nfirm.\n3.2.32 Investments in own shares and capital instruments\n(1) A banking business firm must deduct, from its CET 1 capital, any\ninvestment in its own common shares or own capital instruments\n(except instruments that have been derecognised under IFRS or any\nother relevant accounting standards). The firm must also deduct any of\nits own common shares or instruments that it is contractually obliged to\npurchase.\nNote For the meaning of investment, see rule 3.2.22. In this rule (and elsewhere\nin this Division), investment includes an indirect or synthetic holding.\n(2) The firm must apply the corresponding deduction approach to make the\ndeductions required by this rule.\nNote For the corresponding deduction approach, see rule 3.2.24.\n(3) For this rule, a gross long position may be deducted net of a short\nposition in the same underlying exposure only if the short position\ninvolves no counterparty risk.\n(4) For this rule, the firm must look through its holdings of index securities\nto determine its exposures to its own shares. However, if the firm finds\nit operationally burdensome to look through those holdings and monitor\nits exact exposure to its own shares, the firm may use a conservative\nestimate of such exposures if the Regulatory Authority so approves.\n(5) The firm may net a gross long position in its own shares resulting from\na holding of index securities against a short position in those shares\nresulting from a short position in the same underlying index if the\nmaturity of the short position matches the maturity of the long position.\nGuidance\nIn such cases, the short positions may involve counterparty credit risk (which will be\nsubject to the relevant counterparty credit risk charge).\n(6) This rule applies to an investment whether it is held in the firm’s\nbanking book or trading book.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 39\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.2 Initial and ongoing capital requirements\nRule 3.2.33\n3.2.33 Treatment of reciprocal cross-holdings in banking, financial\nand insurance entities\n(1) A banking business firm must deduct, from its regulatory capital,\nreciprocal cross-holdings in the shares (or other instruments that qualify\nas capital) of a banking, financial or insurance entity if the firm’s\nholding has the effect of artificially inflating the firm’s capital position.\nGuidance\nThe firm should seek guidance from the Regulatory Authority as to whether an entity\nis a financial entity. However, a financial entity might be involved in (for example)\nfinancial leasing, issuing credit cards, portfolio management, investment advisory,\ncustodial and safekeeping services and other similar activities that are ancillary to the\nbusiness of banking.\n(2) The firm must apply the corresponding deduction approach to make the\ndeductions required by this rule.\nNote For the corresponding deduction approach, see rule 3.2.24.\n(3) For this rule, the provision by a banking business firm of support, by\nway of a guarantee or some other capital enhancement, to such an entity\nis to be treated as an investment by the firm in the entity.\n3.2.34 Non-significant investments in unconsolidated banking,\nfinancial or insurance entities\n(1) This rule applies to an investment by a banking business firm in the\ncapital of a banking, financial or insurance entity that is outside the\nscope of regulatory consolidation, if the investment is not a significant\ninvestment.\nNote For the meaning of financial entity, see rule 3.2.33 (1), guidance.\n(2) For this rule and rules 3.2.35 and 3.2.36, significant investment means:\n(a) an investment representing more than 10% of the issued common\nshares, or other instruments that qualify as capital, of the entity; or\n(b) if the entity is affiliated with the firm, an investment representing\nany amount of the issued common shares, or other instruments that\nqualify as capital, of the entity.\nNote For the meaning of affiliated, see subrule (10) (b).\n(3) For this rule, the firm must look through its holdings of index securities\nto determine its exposures to such instruments.

It imposes an obligation to restrict a firm’s\ndistributions when capital falls below the capital conservation buffer\nminimum.\n(3) The counter-cyclical capital buffer is a macroprudential tool that can\nbe used to mitigate the build-up of a system-wide risk such as excess\naggregate credit growth. It is intended to ensure that the banking system\nhas a buffer of capital to protect it against future potential losses.\n(4) These 2 buffers and other requirements on capital are set out in this Part.\n3.3.2 Capital conservation buffer\n(1) A banking business firm whose risk-based capital requirement is higher\nthan its base capital requirement must maintain a minimum capital\nconservation buffer of:\n(a) 2.5% of the firm’s total risk-weighted assets; or\n(b) a higher amount that the Regulatory Authority may, by written\nnotice, set from time to time.\n(2) A firm’s capital conservation buffer must be made up of CET 1 capital\nabove the amounts used to meet the firm’s CET 1 capital ratio, tier 1\ncapital ratio and regulatory capital ratio in rule 3.2.6 (2).\n3.3.3 Capital conservation ratios\n(1) If a banking business firm’s capital conservation buffer falls below the\nrequired minimum, the firm must immediately conserve its capital by\nrestricting its distributions.\nNote A payment made by a firm that does not reduce its CET 1 capital is not a\ndistribution for the purposes of this Part. Distributions include, for example,\ndividends, share buybacks and discretionary bonus payments.\n(2) This rule sets out, in column 3 of table 3.3.3, the minimum capital\nconservation ratios for banking business firms that are required to\nmaintain a capital conservation buffer. Capital conservation ratio is the\npage 46 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nCapital buffers and other requirements Part 3.3\nRule 3.3.4\npercentage of earnings that a firm must not distribute if its CET 1 capital\nratio falls within the corresponding ratio in column 2 of that table.\n(3) Earnings means distributable profits calculated before deducting\nelements subject to the restrictions on distributions. Earnings must be\ncalculated after notionally deducting the tax that would have been\npayable had none of the distributable items been paid.\nNote The effect of calculating earnings after tax is that the tax consequence of the\ndistribution is reversed out.\n(4) A banking business firm must have adequate systems and controls to\nensure that the amount of distributable profits and maximum\ndistributable amount are calculated accurately. The firm must be able to\ndemonstrate that accuracy if directed by the Regulatory Authority.\n(5) If the firm is a member of a financial group, the capital conservation\nbuffer applies at group level.\nTable 3.3.3 Minimum capital conservation ratios\ncolumn 1 column 2 column 3\nitem CET1 capital ratio minimum capital\nconservation ratio\n(% of earnings)\n1 4.5% to 5.125% 100\n2 > 5.125% to 5.75% 80\n3 > 5.75% to 6.375% 60\n4 > 6.375% to 7.0% 40\n5 > 7% 0\nExamples of application of table\nAssume that a firm’s minimum CET 1 capital ratio is 4.5% and an additional 2.5%\ncapital conservation buffer (which must be made up of CET 1 capital) is required for\na total of 7% CET 1 capital ratio. Based on table 3.3.3:\n1 If a firm’s CET 1 capital ratio is 4.5% or more but no more than 5.125%, the firm\nneeds to conserve 100% of its earnings.\n2 If a firm’s CET 1 capital ratio is more than 5.125% or more but no more\nthan 5.75%, the firm needs to conserve 80% of its earnings and must not\ndistribute more than 20% of those earnings by way of dividends, share buybacks\nand discretionary bonus payments.\n3 A firm with a CET 1 capital ratio of more than 7% can distribute 100% of its\nearnings.\n3.3.4 Powers of Regulatory Authority\n(1) The Regulatory Authority may impose a restriction on capital\ndistributions by a firm even if the amount of the firm’s CET 1 capital is\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 47\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.3 Capital buffers and other requirements\nRule 3.3.5\ngreater than its CET 1 capital ratio and required capital conservation\nbuffer.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice, impose a limit on the\nperiod during which a banking business firm may operate within a\nspecified capital conservation ratio.\n(3) A banking business firm may apply to the Regulatory Authority to make\na distribution in excess of a limit imposed by this Part. The authority\nwill grant approval only if it is satisfied that the firm has appropriate\nmeasures to raise capital equal to, or greater than, the amount the firm\nwishes to distribute above the limit.\n3.3.5 Counter-cyclical capital buffer\n(1) If imposed by the Regulatory Authority, the counter-cyclical capital\nbuffer would require a firm to have additional CET 1 capital against\npossible future losses from system-wide risks such as excess credit\ngrowth.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice, require banking\nbusiness firms to have additional CET 1 capital as a counter-cyclical\ncapital buffer. The buffer set by the authority will not exceed 2.5% of\ntotal risk-weighted assets.\n(3) The Regulatory Authority will notify banking business firms of any\ndecision to set, or increase, a counter-cyclical capital buffer within a\nreasonable period of not more than 1 year before the date when the\ndecision takes effect. However, a decision to remove or decrease a\ncounter-cyclical capital buffer will take effect immediately.\n(4) If a counter-cyclical capital buffer applies to a firm, the capital\nconservation ratios (and capital distribution restrictions) in rule 3.3.3\napply to the firm as if its minimum capital conservation buffer were\nincreased by the amount of the counter-cyclical capital buffer.\n3.3.6 Capital reductions\n(1) A banking business firm must not reduce its capital and reserves without\nthe Regulatory Authority’s written approval.\nExamples of ways to reduce capital\n• a share buyback or the redemption, repurchase or repayment of capital\ninstruments issued by the firm\n• trading in the firm’s own shares or capital instruments outside an arrangement\nagreed with the authority\n• a special dividend.\n(2) A banking business firm planning a reduction must prepare a forecast\n(for at least 2 years) showing its projected capital after the reduction.\npage 48 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nCapital buffers and other requirements Part 3.3\nRule 3.3.7\nThe firm must satisfy the authority that the firm’s capital will still\ncomply with these rules after the reduction.\n3.3.7 Authority can require other matters\nDespite anything in these rules, the Regulatory Authority may require a\nbanking business firm to have capital resources, comply with any other\ncapital requirement or use a different approach to, or method for, capital\nmanagement. The authority may also require a firm to carry out stress-\ntesting at any time.\nNote Under FSR, article 16, the Regulatory Authority may modify or waive the\napplication of a prudential requirement to an authorised firm or firms.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 49\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.1 General\nRule 4.1.1\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.1 General\n4.1.1 Introduction\n(1) This Chapter sets out the requirements for a banking business firm’s\ncredit risk management policy and practice (including credit risk\nassessments and the use of ratings from ECRAs) to implement the risk-\nbased framework for capital adequacy and the early identification and\nmanagement of problem assets.\n(2) This Chapter also deals with the following means to determine\nregulatory capital and control or mitigate credit risk:\n(a) the standardised approach for calculating the firm’s credit risk\ncapital requirement;\nNote The standardised approach was previously called the risk-weighted\nassets approach.\n(b) CRM techniques;\n(c) provisioning.\n(3) To guard against abuses and to address conflicts of interest, this Chapter\nrequires transactions with related parties to be at arm’s length.\n4.1.2 Meaning of credit risk\nCredit risk is:\n(a) the risk of default by a counterparty; and\n(b) the risk that an asset will lose value because its credit quality has\ndeteriorated.\nGuidance\nCredit risk may result from exposures on or off the balance sheet, including loans and\nadvances, investments, inter-bank lending, derivative transactions, SFTs and trading\nactivities. It can exist in both the trading book and the banking book.\n4.1.3 General requirements — management of credit risk and\nproblem assets\n(1) A banking business firm must manage credit risk by adopting a prudent\ncredit risk management policy that allows its credit risk to be identified,\nmeasured, evaluated, managed and controlled or mitigated.\npage 50 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nGeneral Part 4.1\nRule 4.1.4\n(2) The policy must also provide for problem assets to be recognised,\nmeasured and reported. The policy must set out the factors that must be\ntaken into account in identifying problem assets.\nNote 1 For the full requirements as to the firm’s credit risk management policy, see\nPart 4.2.\nNote 2 Additional risk management requirements apply to banking business firms’\nexposures to central counterparties — see rules 4.6A.40 and 4.6A.41.\n(3) Problem assets includes non-performing assets (see rule 4.7.10) and\nother assets for which there is reason to believe that the firm may not be\nable to collect the amounts due in full or in accordance with the assets’\nterms.\n(4) A banking business firm must ensure that it has an adequate\nunderstanding of the risk profile and characteristics of each of its\ncounterparties, both at origination and regularly (at least annually)\nafterwards.\n4.1.4 Capital and credit risk\n(1) A banking business firm must have capital to cover credit risk. The\nnecessary amount of capital is the firm’s credit risk capital\nrequirement.\nGuidance\n1 The firm’s credit risk capital requirement is part of its risk-based capital\nrequirement — see rule 3.2.5.\n2 Under rule 3.2.3, a banking business firm must have, at all times, capital at least\nequal to its minimum capital requirement (defined in that rule). The firm’s\nminimum capital requirement cannot be lower than its risk-based capital\nrequirement, of which the credit risk capital requirement is a major part.\nTherefore, the firm must know its credit risk capital requirement at all times.\n(2) A banking business firm’s credit risk capital requirement is the sum of\nthe following components:\n(a) the total of the firm’s risk-weighted assets for each of the\nfollowing:\n(i) exposures in the banking book (except those mentioned in\nsubparagraphs (ii) to (iv)), calculated using the standardised\napproach (see Divisions 4.4.B and 4.4.C);\n(ii) unsettled transactions and failed trades, in both the banking\nbook and the trading book (see Subdivision 4.4.B.12);\n(iii) defaulted exposures, in both the banking book and the trading\nbook (see Subdivision 4.4.B.13);\n(iv) securitisation exposures in the banking book (see Divisions\n4.6.E, 4.6.F and 4.6.G);\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 51\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.1 General\nRule 4.1.4\n(b) the firm’s capital requirements for counterparty credit risk, for\nexposures in both the banking book and the trading book (see\nPart 4.6A).\npage 52 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk management Part 4.2\nRule 4.2.1\nPart 4.2 Credit risk management\nDivision 4.2.A Principles for credit risk management\nSubdivision 4.2.A.1 Establishing appropriate credit risk\nenvironment\n4.2.1 Principle 1: governing body’s responsibilities\nA banking business firm’s governing body is responsible for approving\nand periodically (at least annually) reviewing the firm’s credit risk\nstrategy and significant credit risk policies.

In determining\nfair values, the firm must use conservative estimates in imputing future\nincome streams, such as lease payments that are not already contracted\nfor.\n(4) The firm must ensure that the key assumptions used in the valuation\napproach are appropriate and that there is sufficient evidence to support\nthem. The firm must review the assumptions and must be satisfied that\nthey are reasonable before the valuation is done.\n(5) In determining fair values, a valuation that is based on highest and best\nuse rather than existing use must be adequately supported and\ndocumented.If applicable, the valuation report must set out how highest\nand best use was determined.\n(6) In circumstances in which it is difficult to determine the fair value of a\nproperty that has not yet achieved a stable income, or that is\nexperiencing fluctuations in income, a forecast of expected cash flows\nmust be used to estimate the value of the property.\n(7) The discount rates used in calculating the value of security must reflect\nthe opportunity cost of holding the property, determined by way of\ncomparison with prevailing returns on competing investments, and\nassuming a long-term holding.

If no ECRA has issued a rating of an instrument or a counterparty, the\ninstrument or counterparty is unrated.\n(2) A rating is a solicited rating if the rating was requested and paid for by\nthe issuer of the rated instrument, the rated counterparty or another\nentity in the same corporate group as the issuer or counterparty. Any\nother rating is an unsolicited rating.\nNote Unsolicited ratings are not to be used without the Regulatory Authority’s\nconsent — see rule 4.3.5.\npage 74 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit ratings Part 4.3\nRule 4.3.4\n4.3.4 Using ratings\n(1) A banking business firm must use ratings consistently and in accordance\nwith these rules and its credit risk management policy.\n(2) The firm must ensure that a rating of an instrument takes into account\nthe total amount of the relevant exposure (that is, the principal and any\ninterest due).\n4.3.5 Only solicited ratings to be used\n(1) Subject to subrule (2), a banking business firm must use only a solicited\nrating in determining risk weights for the firm’s exposures.\n(2) A banking business firm may use an unsolicited rating with the written\napproval of the Regulatory Authority or in accordance with a direction\nby the Authority. The Authority may give a written direction setting out\nconditions that must be satisfied before the firm may use an unsolicited\nrating.\n4.3.6 Multiple ratings for same exposure etc\n(1) If there is only 1 rating for a particular exposure, that rating must be\nused to assign a risk weight to the exposure.\n(2) If there are 2 ratings and the ratings map to different risk weights, the\nhigher risk-weight must be applied.\n(3) If there are 3 or more ratings for an exposure, and those ratings map to\ndifferent risk weights, only the ratings that map to the 2 lowest risk\nweights may be taken into account, and:\n(a) the higher of those 2 risk weights must be applied; or\n(b) if both ratings map to the same risk weight, that risk weight must\nbe applied.\n4.3.7 Choosing between issuer ratings and issue ratings\n(1) If an issue to which a banking business firm is exposed has an issue-\nspecific rating, the firm must use that rating to assign a risk weight to\nthe exposure.\n(2) For an exposure to an issue that does not have an issue-specific rating,\nthe firm must assign a risk weight to it as set out in subrules (3) to (5).\n(3) If an issuer has a specific rating for an issue, but the firm’s exposure to\nthe issuer is not to that issue, the firm may assign to its exposure a risk\nweight lower than that for an unrated exposure only if the firm’s claim\non the issuer ranks equally with, or is senior to, the rated issue.\nOtherwise the firm must treat the exposure as unrated.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 75\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.3 Credit ratings\nRule 4.3.8\n(4) If the firm’s exposure is to an unrated issue by the issuer and:\n(a) either the issuer, or another issue by it, has a low-quality rating\n(that is, a rating that would map into a risk weight equal to or\nhigher than that for an unrated exposure); and\n(b) the issue to which the firm is exposed ranks equally with, or is\njunior to, either a senior unsecured claim on the issuer or the issue\nwith a low-quality rating;\nthe firm must assign the same risk weight to the unrated exposure as it\nwould to the issue with the low-quality rating.\nGuidance\nIf the issuer has an issuer rating, that rating typically applies to senior unsecured claims\non that issuer. Consequently, only senior claims on that issuer benefit from a high-\nquality issuer rating. Other unassessed exposures of a highly rated issuer are treated as\nunrated.\n(5) If an issuer has a specific high-quality rating (that is, a rating that would\nmap to a lower risk weight) that applies only to a limited class of its\nliabilities (such as a deposit assessment or a counterparty risk\nassessment), the firm may use that rating only for exposures to the issuer\nthat fall within that class.\n4.3.8 Ratings within financial group\nA banking business firm must not use a rating for 1 entity in a financial\ngroup to assign a risk weight to an unrated entity in the group.\nGuidance\nIf the rated entity has guaranteed the unrated entity’s exposure to the firm, the firm\nmay take the guarantee into account as credit risk mitigation under Division 4.5.C if\nthe guarantee is an eligible guarantee (see rule 4.5.27).\n4.3.9 Using foreign currency and domestic currency ratings of\nsimilar exposures to same counterparty\n(1) If a banking business firm proposes to assign a risk weight to an unrated\nexposure based on the rating of a rated (but otherwise similar) exposure\nto the same counterparty, it may do so if either of the following\nparagraphs is true:\n(a) the rating is a domestic-currency rating and the rated exposure is\ndenominated in the counterparty’s domestic currency;\n(b) the rating is a foreign-currency rating and the rated exposure is\ndenominated in a foreign currency.\n(2) Subrule (3) applies to an exposure that arises through a banking business\nfirm’s participation in a loan that has been extended, or has been\nguaranteed against convertibility and transfer risk, by an MDB, if an\npage 76 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit ratings Part 4.3\nRule 4.3.10\nexposure to the MDB is to be assigned a risk weight of 0% under\nrule 4.4.16.\n(3) For an exposure to which this subrule applies, the borrower’s domestic\ncurrency rating may be used to assign a risk weight to the exposure\ninstead of its foreign currency rating. In the case of a guarantee against\nconvertibility and transfer risk, the local currency rating may be used\nonly for the part that has been guaranteed, and the remainder that does\nnot benefit from the guarantee must be assigned a risk-weight based on\nthe borrower’s foreign currency rating.\n4.3.10 Using short-term ratings\n(1) A banking business firm may use a short-term rating to assign a risk\nweight only to a short-term bank exposure or short-term corporate\nexposure.\n(2) For risk weighting purposes, a banking business firm must treat a short-\nterm rating as being issue-specific. The firm may use a short-term rating\nto assign a risk weight only to an exposure arising from the rated facility,\nand must not apply it to any other short-term exposure.\n(3) A banking business firm must not use a short-term rating to assign a risk\nweight to an unrated long-term exposure.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 77\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.1\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to\ncalculating credit risk capital\nrequirement\nDivision 4.4.A General\n4.4.1 What Part 4.4 does — calculation of risk-weighted assets\nfor credit risk\n(1) This Part sets out how a banking business firm must calculate its risk-\nweighted assets for credit risk.\nGuidance\n1 A banking business firm’s credit risk capital requirement is the sum of:\n• its risk-weighted assets for credit risk, as calculated in accordance with this\nPart (but subject to any capital relief that is available under Part 4.5)\n• its risk-weighted assets for securitisation exposures in the banking book\n(see Divisions 4.6.E, 4.6.F and 4.6.G).\n2 For how to calculate the firm’s credit risk capital requirement, see rule 4.1.4. The\nfollowing components of the credit risk capital requirement are calculated in\naccordance with this Part:\n• RWA for exposures in the banking book (except those mentioned in the\nnext point)\n• RWA for the risk posed by unsettled transactions and failed trades, in both\nthe banking book and the trading book.\n3 The firm’s RWA for counterparty credit risk for exposures in both the banking\nbook and the trading book also forms part of its credit risk capital requirement.\nThis is dealt with in Part 4.6A.\n4 The sum of a banking business firm’s risk-weighted assets for credit risk, used\nfor calculating its credit risk capital requirement, is not the same as its total risk-\nweighted assets (see rule 3.2.1), which is used for calculating the firm’s capital\nadequacy ratios under Chapter 3.\n4.4.2 Application of Part 4.4 between banking book and trading\nbook\nThis Part applies only to assets and exposures held in a banking business\nfirm’s banking book unless a rule specifies otherwise.\nNote Subdivisions 4.4.B.12 (unsettled or failed transactions) and 4.4.B.13\n(defaulted exposures) and Part 4.6A (counterparty credit risk) apply to assets\nand exposures in both banking and trading books.\npage 78 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.3\n4.4.3 Risk weights to be assigned\n(1) A banking business firm must assign risk weights to on-balance-sheet\nexposures and off-balance-sheet items. This Part sets out how to do so.\nGuidance\nRisk weights are broadly aligned with the likelihood of the counterparty’s default. If\nan exposure or item is rated (see rule 4.3.3), the risk weight to be assigned is\ndetermined in accordance with the rating; otherwise, the risk weight is determined\ndirectly by this Part (but in both cases subject to the outcome of due diligence by the\nfirm (see rules 4.2.25, 4.2.26 and 4.2.27).\n(2) The firm must assign the risk weight set out in, or determined in\naccordance with, this Part to a claim or asset, subject to:\n(a) the outcome of the credit assessment required by rules 4.2.25,\n4.2.26 and 4.2.27; and\n(b) its assessment of the exposure, as required by rule 4.4.4.\n(3) Under this Part, risk weights must be assigned to exposures of a\nparticular kind at specified levels (for example, in the case of rated bank\nexposures (other than certain short-term exposures), the risk weights\nthat can be assigned are 20%, 30%, 50%, 100% and 150%, according to\nthe rating of the counterparty (see rule 4.4.18)). If this Part specifies a\nset of such levels in relation to a kind of exposure, only risk weights in\nthe set may be assigned to such an exposure.\nGuidance\nSubrule (3) would prevent a banking business firm from assigning an intermediate risk\nweight (say 60%) to a rated bank exposure.\n(4) For the purpose of assigning risk-weights, interest is treated as\nsuspended on a non-performing exposure.\n4.4.4 Requirement to decide whether risk weight appropriate\n(1) A banking business firm must assess every exposure (whether rated or\nunrated) to decide whether the risk weight to be assigned to it under this\nPart is appropriate. The firm’s decision must be based on the exposure’s\ninherent risk.\n(2) If there are reasonable grounds to believe that the inherent risk of an\nexposure is significantly higher than that implied by the risk weight to\nbe assigned to it under this Part, the firm must consider the higher risk\n(and assign a higher risk weight) for the purpose of calculating its credit\nrisk capital requirement.\n(3) In particular, the firm must use the results of due diligence carried out\non the counterparty to decide whether a risk weight that is solely based\non a rating would be appropriate and prudent. If the results show that\nthe exposure poses greater risk than is implied by the rating, the firm\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 79\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.5\nmust assign a higher risk weight to the exposure than the risk weight\nthat would be assigned on the basis of the rating.\nNote For the risk weights that can be assigned, see rule 4.4.3 (3).\n(4) However, due diligence analysis must never result in the application of\na lower risk weight than that determined by the rating.\n(5) For an exposure to an entity that is part of a corporate group, the firm\nmust, as far as possible, carry out due diligence at the level of the entity\nto which there is an exposure. However, in evaluating the entity’s\nrepayment capacity, the firm must take into account the support of the\ngroup and the possibility that the support would be adversely affected\nby problems in the group.\n4.4.5 Relation to CRM techniques\nIf a claim, exposure or asset to which a banking business firm must\nassign a risk weight is covered by a CRM technique, the firm may take\nthe effect of that technique into account, in accordance with Part 4.5, to\nreduce the firm’s credit risk capital requirement.\n4.4.6 Regulatory Authority can direct firms as to risk weights and\nimpose requirements\n(1) Despite anything in these rules, the Regulatory Authority may direct a\nbanking business firm as to the risk weight to be assigned to a particular\nexposure if the Authority considers that the firm has assigned an\ninappropriate risk weight to the exposure. The direction must be in\nwriting.\n(2) The Authority may also impose specific capital requirements or limits\non significant exposures, including any exposure that, in the Authority’s\nopinion, has not been adequately transferred or mitigated.\n4.4.7 Risk weight multiplier for exposures with currency\nmismatch\n(1) This rule applies to an exposure if:\n(a) the exposure and the counterparty’s income are denominated in\ndifferent currencies; and\n(b) the counterparty does not have a sufficient natural or financial\nhedge against the resulting foreign exchange risk.\nGuidance\nA counterparty has a natural hedge if the borrower normally receives foreign currency\nincome (such as remittances, rental incomes, or salaries) in the currency of the relevant\nloan. A financial hedge generally includes a contract with a financial institution.\npage 80 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.8\n(2) This rule applies to all exposures referred to in subrule (1) regardless of\nwhether the exposure is to an individual, a corporate body or a\nsovereign.\n(3) The exposure must be assigned a risk weight 1.5 times the risk weight\nthat would otherwise be assigned under this Part, subject to a maximum\nrisk weight of 150%.\nDivision 4.4.B Standardised approach — on-balance-\nsheet exposures\nSubdivision 4.4.B.1 General concepts and definitions\n4.4.8 Scope of Division 4.4.B\nThis Division is about how a banking business firm must assign risk\nweights to exposures that are held on its balance sheet.\nNote This Division applies only to exposures in the banking book unless a rule\nprovides otherwise — see rule 4.4.2.\n4.4.9 Types of exposures by counterparty\n(1) For this Division, an exposure on a banking business firm’s balance\nsheet may be classified as of one of the following types:\n(a) a sovereign exposure (see subrule (2));\n(b) a PSE exposure (see subrule (3));\n(c) an MDB exposure (see subrule (4));\n(d) a bank exposure (see subrule (5));\n(e) a corporate exposure (see subrule (6)).\n(2) A sovereign exposure is a claim on a counterparty that is:\n(a) a national government (or the government of a body politic that is\npart of a nation, such as a State or Province);\n(b) a national central bank; or\n(c) a body whose obligations are implicitly or explicitly guaranteed by\na national government or the government of a part of a nation.\n(3) A PSE exposure is a claim on a counterparty that is a PSE.\n(4) An MDB exposure is a claim on a counterparty that is an MDB.\n(5) A bank exposure is a claim on a financial institution that is licensed to\ntake deposits and is subject to standards and a level of supervision\ncompliant with the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\npublished by the BCBS in April 2024.\nNote 1 The Principles are available at: https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d573.pdf.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 81\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.10\nNote 2 Some exposures to securities firms may be treated as bank exposures — see\nrule 4.4.17 (3).\n(6) A corporate exposure is a claim that is not a sovereign exposure, a PSE\nexposure, an MDB exposure, a bank exposure nor a retail exposure.\n(7) For this Division, a retail exposure is an exposure that would qualify\nfor inclusion in the regulatory retail portfolio under the criteria in\nCRE20.65 in the Basel III framework.\nGuidance\nQFC banking business firms are not permitted to undertake retail banking.\n4.4.10 Types of exposures identified in other ways\nFor this Division, exposures on a banking business firm’s balance sheet\ncan also be classified as follows:\n(a) specialised lending exposures (see Subdivision 4.4.B.7);\n(b) exposures to subordinated debt, equity and other capital\ninstruments (see Subdivision 4.4.B.8);\n(c) exposures to equity investments in investment funds (see\nSubdivision 4.4.B.9);\n(d) exposures secured on real estate (see Subdivision 4.4.B.10);\n(e) exposures to covered bonds (see Subdivision 4.4.B.11);\n(f) exposures from unsettled or failed transactions (see\nSubdivision 4.4.B.12);\n(g) defaulted exposures (see Subdivision 4.4.B.13);\n(h) exposures that are not otherwise provided for (see\nSubdivision 4.4.B.14).\nGuidance\nMost of the exposures classified in this rule would be corporate exposures, but are\ntreated specially because of their particular characteristics.\nSubdivision 4.4.B.2 Sovereign exposures\n4.4.11 Scope of Subdivision 4.4.B.2\n(1) This Subdivision is about how a banking business firm must assign risk\nweights to sovereign exposures that are on its balance sheet.\n(2) This Subdivision does not apply to a defaulted exposure, nor to an\nexposure resulting from an unsettled or failed transaction.\nNote For the treatment of exposures resulting from unsettled or failed transactions\nand defaulted exposures, see Subdivisions 4.4.B.12 and 4.4.B.13\nrespectively.\npage 82 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.12\n4.4.12 Risk weights — sovereign exposures\n(1) An exposure to any of the following must be assigned a risk weight of\n0% if it is denominated and funded in Qatari riyals:\n(a) the State of Qatar;\n(b) the Qatar Central Bank;\n(c) the Qatar Foundation;\n(d) the Qatar Investment Authority;\n(e) QatarEnergy.\n(2) Any other sovereign exposure must be assigned a risk weight in\naccordance with table 4.4.12.\nNote Exposures that have an unhedged currency mismatch may be subject to a\nrisk weight multiplier — see rule 4.4.7.\nTable 4.4.12 Risk weights for sovereign exposures\nRating Risk weight (%)\nAAA to AA- 0\nA+ to A- 20\nBBB+ to BBB- 50\nBB+ to B- 100\nBelow B- 150\nUnrated 100\nSubdivision 4.4.B.3 PSE exposures\n4.4.13 Scope of Subdivision 4.4.B.3\n(1) This Subdivision is about how a banking business firm must assign risk\nweights to PSE exposures that are on its balance sheet.\n(2) This Subdivision does not apply to a defaulted exposure, nor to an\nexposure resulting from an unsettled or failed transaction.\nNote For the treatment of exposures resulting from unsettled or failed transactions\nand defaulted exposures, see Subdivisions 4.4.B.12 and 4.4.B.13\nrespectively.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 83\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.14\n4.4.14 Risk weights — PSE exposures\n(1) A banking business firm may assign a risk weight of 0% to an exposure\nto a non-commercial PSE in Qatar that is denominated in Qatari riyals.\nGuidance — deciding whether a PSE is commercial\n1 The following examples outline how PSEs might be categorised when focusing\non one specific feature, namely revenue-raising powers. However, there may be\nother ways of determining the different treatments applicable to different types\nof PSEs; for instance, by focusing on the extent of guarantees provided by the\ncentral government.\n2 A claim on a regional government or local authority could qualify for the same\ntreatment as a claim on its sovereign or central government if the government or\nauthority has revenue-raising powers and institutional arrangements the effect of\nwhich is to reduce its risk of default.\n3 A claim on an administrative body that is responsible to a central government,\nregional government or local authority, or on another non-commercial\nundertaking owned by a government or local authority, may not warrant the same\ntreatment as a claim on the sovereign if the body does not have revenue-raising\npowers or other arrangements as described. If strict lending rules apply to such a\nbody or a declaration of bankruptcy is not possible because of its special public\nstatus, it may be appropriate to treat the body as a PSE.\n4 A commercial undertaking owned by a central government, regional government\nor local authority may be treated as a normal commercial enterprise. In particular,\nif such an undertaking functions as a corporate in competitive markets even\nthough the central government, a regional authority or a local authority is the\nmajor shareholder, the undertaking should be treated as a corporate and exposures\nto it should be assigned risk weights accordingly.\n(2) The firm must assign a risk weight to any other PSE exposure in\naccordance with table 4.4.14.\nNote Exposures that have an unhedged currency mismatch may be subject to a\nrisk weight multiplier — see rule 4.4.7.\nTable 4.4.14 Risk weights for PSE exposures\nRating of relevant Risk weight (%)\nsovereign\nAAA to AA- 20\nA+ to A- 50\nBBB+ to BBB- 50\nBB+ to B- 100\nBelow B- 150\nUnrated 50\npage 84 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.15\nSubdivision 4.4.B.4 MDB exposures\n4.4.15 Scope of Subdivision 4.4.B.4 — MDB exposures\n(1) This Subdivision is about how a banking business firm must assign risk\nweights to MDB exposures that are on its balance sheet.\n(2) This Subdivision does not apply to a defaulted exposure, nor to an\nexposure resulting from an unsettled or failed transaction.\nNote For the treatment of exposures resulting from unsettled or failed transactions\nand defaulted exposures, see Subdivisions 4.4.B.12 and 4.4.B.13\nrespectively.\n4.4.16 Risk weight — MDB exposures\n(1) A banking business firm may assign a risk weight of 0% to an exposure\nto any of the following MDBs:\n(a) the African Development Bank (AfDB);\n(b) the Asian Development Bank (ADB);\n(c) the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank;\n(d) the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB);\n(e) the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEDB);\n(f) the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD);\n(g) the European Investment Bank (EIB);\n(h) the European Investment Fund (EIF);\n(i) the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB);\n(j) the International Finance Facility for Immunization;\n(k) the Islamic Development Bank (IDB);\n(l) the Nordic Investment Bank (NIB);\n(m) the World Bank Group (comprising the International Bank for\nReconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International\nFinance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee\nAgency (MIGA) and the International Development Association\n(IDA)).\n(2) The firm must assign a risk weight to an exposure to any other MDB in\naccordance with table 4.4.16, but may assign a risk weight of 0% if the\nRegulatory Authority so approves.\nGuidance\nThe Authority will evaluate eligibility for 0% risk weight case by case.

For how much of such an investment the firm must take into\naccount, see subrule (3).\n(2) This subrule applies to a fund that is established under a law of Qatar if\nall of the following are true of the law:\n(a) its purpose is to promote investment in a particular sector or sectors\nof the Qatari economy;\n(b) it authorises a subsidy for an investment in the fund;\n(c) it provides for oversight of the fund by the government of Qatar.\npage 100 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.41\n(3) The firm must take into account any part of such an investment that is\nmore than 10% of the firm’s total regulatory capital.\nNote For the meaning of total regulatory capital, see rule 3.1.1 (2).\n4.4.41 Funds whose debt can be risk-weighted at 0%\nWith the prior approval of the Regulatory Authority, a banking business\nfirm may assign a risk weight of 0% to an equity investment in a fund if\nthe fund’s debt instruments may be assigned a 0% risk weight under this\nDivision.\n4.4.42 Calculation of RWA for investment in fund — approaches\n(1) There are 3 approaches that may be used (separately or in combination)\nto calculate the RWA for a banking business firm’s investment in a\nfund:\n(a) the look-through approach (LTA);\n(b) the mandate-based approach (MBA); and\n(c) the fall-back approach (FBA).\nGuidance\n1 The LTA assigns risk weights to the fund’s exposures as if they were held directly\nby the banking business firm concerned. It is the most granular and risk-sensitive\napproach. However, the necessary information to use it may not be available.\n2 The MBA relies on information in a fund’s mandate or the law governing the\nfund to assign risk weights to the fund’s exposures.\n3 The FBA is used only when neither of the other approaches is possible.\n(2) If the fund’s RWA was calculated by the LTA or the MBA, the fund’s\nRWA is subject to a leverage adjustment (see rule 4.4.52) to calculate\nthe RWA for the firm’s investment in the fund.\nGuidance\nUnder the LTA or the MBA, the firm calculates the RWA for an investment in a fund\nby first calculating an RWA for the fund. The RWA for the firm’s investment in the\nfund is taken (subject to the leverage adjustment) to be the fund’s total RWA\nmultiplied by the percentage of the fund’s total equity that the firm holds.\n4.4.43 When to use LTA\n(1) If the conditions in subrule (2) are satisfied, a banking business firm\nmust use the LTA to assign a risk weight to a fund’s exposures to its\nunderlyings.\n(2) The conditions are the following:\n(a) the fund provides the firm with sufficient information about the\nfund’s underlying exposures to allow the firm to calculate the\nrelevant risk weights;\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 101\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.44\n(b) the fund provides that information as often as necessary for that\npurpose;\n(c) the information is verified by an independent third party (for\nexample, the depository, the custodian bank, or, if there is a fund\nmanagement company, that company).\n4.4.44 Applying LTA\n(1) Under the LTA, risk weights are assigned to the exposures of the fund\nas if the banking business firm concerned held those exposures directly.\nGuidance\nSuch exposures include, for example, underlying exposure arising from the fund’s\nderivatives activities for situations in which the underlying receives a risk weighting\ntreatment under Part 4.6A and the associated counterparty credit risk exposure.\n(2) In determining the counterparty credit risk for the fund’s exposures to\nderivatives, the firm must multiply the relevant exposure (calculated in\naccordance with Part 4.6A) by 1.5 before applying the risk weight\nassociated with the counterparty.\n(3) The firm may rely on a third party’s calculations if the conditions in rule\n4.4.47 are met.\n4.4.45 When to use MBA\nA banking business firm may use the MBA if the conditions for using\nthe LTA are not satisfied, but enough information to apply the MBA is\navailable from the fund’s mandate, the applicable law or other reliable,\npublic sources.\n4.4.46 Applying MBA\n(1) Under the MBA, the total RWA for a fund’s exposures is the sum of the\nfollowing:\n(a) the total RWA for exposures on the fund’s balance sheet,\ncalculated as set out in subrule (2);\n(b) the total RWA for the fund’s derivative exposures and other off-\nbalance-sheet items, calculated as set out in subrule (3);\n(c) the total RWA for the fund’s derivative exposures, calculated in\naccordance with Part 4.6A.\n(2) For paragraph (1) (a), the calculation must assume that the fund’s\nunderlying portfolios are invested to the greatest extent allowed under\nits mandate in assets that attract the highest capital requirements, and\nthen progressively in other assets that attract lower capital requirements.\nIf more than 1 risk weight can be assigned to an exposure, the highest\nrisk weight applicable must be assigned.\npage 102 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.47\n(3) For paragraph (1) (b):\n(a) in the case of an off-balance-sheet item, if the underlying would\nreceive a risk weight under Division 4.4.C, the notional amount of\nthe item must be assigned a risk weight accordingly; and\n(b) in the case of a derivative exposure, if the underlying would\nreceive a risk weight under Part 4.6A the notional amount of the\nexposure must be assigned a risk weight accordingly.\n(4) The firm may rely on a third party’s calculations if the conditions in rule\n4.4.47 are met.\n4.4.47 Applying LTA or MBA —using third party’s calculations\n(1) The conditions under which a banking business firm may use a third\nparty’s calculations of the risk weight of the firm’s investment in a fund\nare the following:\n(a) the party that does the calculation is:\n(i) if the fund invests only in securities and deposits the\nsecurities at a depository institution — the depository; or\n(ii) another entity approved by the Regulatory Authority;\n(b) the calculations are done in accordance with the LTA or the MBA;\n(c) the firm is given complete access to the calculations and data;\n(d) before the firm uses the results of such a calculation in a prudential\nreport, the calculation is reviewed by the firm’s internal audit\nfunction;\n(e) all the calculations for a year are reviewed by the firm’s external\nauditor as part of the firm’s annual audit.\n(2) If the firm uses a third party’s calculations of the risk weight of the\nfirm’s investment in a fund, the firm must assign, to its exposure to the\nfund, a risk weight 1.2 times the risk weight that the firm would have\nassigned if it had held the exposure directly.\n(3) However, if the firm has access to the calculations, and the Regulatory\nAuthority so requests, the firm must provide the Authority with details\nof the calculations. In this case, subrule (2) does not apply.\nGuidance\nIf the firm uses a third party’s calculations, and provides the Authority with details of\nthe calculations as set out in subrule (3), the firm must assign risk weights in\naccordance with rule 4.4.44 or 4.4.46, according to the method that the firm used\ninitially.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 103\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.48\n4.4.48 When to use FBA\nA banking business firm must use the FBA if it cannot use either the\nLTA or the MBA.\n4.4.49 Applying FBA\nUnder the FBA, a banking business firm must assign a risk weight of\n1,250% to the firm’s equity in the relevant fund.\n4.4.51 Treatment of funds’ investments in other funds\n(1) If a banking business firm has an investment in a fund (fund 1) that has\nan investment in another fund (fund 2), and either the LTA or the MBA\nwas used to calculate the RWA of fund 1, the risk weight to be assigned\nto fund 2 can be calculated by using the LTA, MBA or FBA (as the\navailable information permits).\n(2) For all subsequent layers (such as fund 2’s investment in another fund\n(fund 3) and so on), the risk weights applied to fund n can be calculated\nby using the LTA only if the LTA was used for determining the risk\nweight for fund (n-1). Otherwise, the FBA must be applied.\n4.4.52 Leverage adjustment\n(1) If a banking business firm has calculated the RWA for a fund using\neither the LTA or the MBA, it must apply a leverage adjustment to that\nRWA. The result of applying the leverage adjustment is taken as the\nRWA for the firm’s investment in the fund.\n(2) If LTA or MBA is used to calculate the RWA for a banking business\nfirm’s investment in a fund, the RWA for the investment is calculated\nby the following formula:\n𝑅𝑊𝐴\n𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑\n𝑅𝑊𝐴 = ×𝐿𝑣 ×𝐸𝑞\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠\n𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑\nwhere:\nRWA is the fund’s total RWA.\nfund\nTotal assets is the fund’s total assets, according to its latest balance\nfund\nsheet.\nLv is:\n(a) if the LTA was applied — the fund’s actual leverage (that is, the\nfund’s total assets divided by its equity, expressed as a percentage);\n(b) if the MBA was applied — the highest rate of leverage permitted\nby the relevant mandate or law.\npage 104 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.52\nEq is the firm’s equity in the fund (that is, the product of the fund’s total\nequity and the percentage of that equity that the firm holds).\n(3) However, the application of a leverage adjustment to an investment in a\nfund is not to increase the risk weight of the investment higher than\n1,250%.\nExample\nConsider a fund that replicates an equity index. A banking business firm holds 20% of\nthe fund’s shares. Also, assume that:\n(1) the firm uses the standardised approach (as set out in Divisions 4.4.B and 4.4.C)\nwhen calculating its capital requirements for credit risk, and it uses the\nstandardised approach for determining counterparty credit risk exposures;\n(2) the fund holds forward contracts on listed equities that are cleared through a\nQCCP (with a notional amount of 100); and\n(3) the fund presents the following balance sheet:\nAssets\nCash 20\nGovernment bonds (AAA-rated) 30\nVM receivable (that is, collateral 50\nposted by the firm to the CCP in\nrespect of the forward contracts)\nLiabilities\nNotes payable 5\nEquity\nShares, retained earnings and other 95\nreserves\nThe fund’s exposures must be risk-weighted as follows:\n(1) the RWA for the cash (RWA ) is the exposure of 20 multiplied by the applicable\ncash\nSA risk weight of 0%. Thus, RWA = 0;\ncash\n(2) the RWA for the government bonds (RWA ) is the exposure of 30 multiplied\nbonds\nby the applicable SA risk weight of 0%. Thus, RWA = 0;\nbonds\n(3) the RWA for the exposures to the listed equities underlying the forward contracts\n(RWA ) is the product of the following 3 amounts:\nunderlying\n(a) the SA credit conversion factor of 100% that is applicable to forward\npurchases;\n(b) the exposure to the notional amount of $100;\n(c) the applicable risk weight for listed equities under the SA which is 100%;\nthus, RWA = 100% × 100 × 100% = 100;\nunderlying\n(4) the forward purchase equities expose the bank to counterparty credit risk in\nrespect of the market value of the forwards and the collateral posted that is not\nheld by the CCP on a bankruptcy-remote basis. For the sake of simplicity, assume\nthat the application of Part 4.6A results in an exposure value of $56. The RWA\nfor counterparty credit risk (RWA ) is the product of the exposure amount and\nCCR\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 105\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.53\nthe relevant risk weight for trade exposures to CCPs, which is 2% in this case\n(see Division 4.6A.D for the capital requirements for bank exposures to CCPs).\nThus, RWA = $56 × 2% = $1.12. (For the sake of simplicity, this example\nCCR\ndoes not include capital requirements for exposures to CCPs or the credit\nvaluation adjustment framework.)\nThe total RWA of the fund is therefore $101.12 = (0 + 0 +100 + 1.12).\nThe leverage of a fund under the LTA is the ratio of the fund’s total assets to its total\n100\nequity, which in this example is .\n95\nTherefore, the RWA for the bank’s equity investment in the fund is the product of the\naverage risk weight of the fund, the fund’s leverage and the size of the bank’s equity\ninvestment — that is:\n𝑅𝑊𝐴\n𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑\n𝑅𝑊𝐴= ×𝐿𝑣×𝐸𝑞\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠\n𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑\nor\n101.12 100\n× ×(95×20%)=$=20.2.\n100 95\nGuidance\nThe counterparty credit risk exposure of a netting set of derivatives is calculated by\nmultiplying the sum of the replacement cost and potential future exposure by an alpha\nfactor set at 1.4. Whenever the replacement cost is unknown, the exposure measure\nfor counterparty credit risk will be calculated conservatively by using the sum of the\nnotional amounts of the derivatives in the netting set as a proxy for the replacement\ncost, and the multiplier used in the calculation of the potential future exposure will be\nequal to 1. Whenever the potential future exposure is unknown, it will be calculated\nas 15% of the sum of the notional values of the derivatives in the netting set.

The value of the property must not depend materially on the\nperformance of the borrower.\n(7) Required documentation: all the information required at loan\norigination and for monitoring purposes must be properly documented,\nincluding information on:\n(a) the borrower’s ability to repay; and\n(b) the valuation of the property.\n4.4.57 Recognition of second mortgages\nDespite rule 4.4.56 (4), where the banking business firm concerned does\nnot hold a first mortgage over the relevant property, the Regulatory\nAuthority may approve, as a credit risk mitigant for the purposes of this\nSubdivision, a second or subsequent mortgage if, under the law of the\nrelevant jurisdiction, all of the following requirements are satisfied:\n(a) a second or subsequent mortgage gives the mortgagee a claim that\nis legally enforceable and constitutes an effective credit risk\nmitigant;\n(b) any mortgagee can initiate the sale of the property independently\nfrom the other mortgagees;\n(c) if the sale were not carried out by public auction, a mortgagee that\nheld a higher-priority mortgage would be obliged to take\nreasonable steps to obtain a fair market value (or the best price that\ncould be obtained in the circumstances) when exercising its power\nof sale.\nGuidance\nParagraph (c) implies that it must be impossible for a prior mortgagee to sell the\nproperty at a discount to the disadvantage of a subsequent mortgagee.\n4.4.58 Underwriting policies\n(1) A banking business firm must have an underwriting policy in relation to\nthe granting of mortgage loans that requires the firm to assess a\nborrower’s ability to repay such a loan.\npage 108 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.59\n(2) The policy must define 1 or more appropriate criteria (such as the loan’s\ndebt service coverage ratio) and must specify the relevant levels for the\npurpose of that assessment.\n(3) The policy must be appropriate even when the repayment of the\nmortgage loan depends significantly on the cash flows generated by the\nproperty, and must take into account relevant measurements such as the\nproperty’s occupancy rate.\n4.4.59 Valuation of property\n(1) The property’s value must be determined independentlyusing prudently\nconservative valuation criteria. The valuation process must not include\nany expectations of price increases.\n(2) If a market value can be determined for the property, the value of the\nproperty for the purposes of the loan must not be higher than that market\nvalue.\n4.4.60 How to calculate LTV ratio\n(1) A banking business firm must calculate the LTV ratio for a proposed\nreal estate loan prudently in accordance with the following\nrequirements:\n(a) the loan amount must include any outstanding loan amount and\nany undrawn committed amount of the loan;\n(b) the loan amount must be calculated gross of any provisions and\nother risk mitigants (except for pledged deposit accounts with the\nfirm that meet all the requirements for netting on the firm’s balance\nsheet and have been unconditionally and irrevocably pledged for\nthe sole purpose of repaying the loan);\n(c) the value must be adjusted to take into account the possibility that\nthe current market price is significantly above the value that would\nbe sustainable over the life of the loan.\n(2) The value of the property must continue to be its value at the origination\nof the loan, unless the Regulatory Authority directs the firm to reduce\nthe value. Modifications made to the property that unequivocally\nincrease its value may be taken into account.\n(3) However, the firm may reduce the property’s value if an extraordinary\nevent permanently reduces the property’s value.\n4.4.61 Recognition of collateral and guarantees\n(1) In calculating the amount of an exposure for the purposes of this\nSubdivision, a banking business firm may take into account financial\ncollateral or a guarantee as a credit risk mitigant if the guarantee or\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 109\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.62\ncollateral qualifies as eligible collateral or an eligible guarantee (as the\ncase may be) under Part 4.5.\nNote For what qualifies as eligible collateral, see rule 4.5.12. For what qualifies\nas an eligible guarantee, see rule 4.5.27.\n(2) The firm may also take into account mortgage indemnity insurance that\nmeets the requirements of Part 4.5 for a guarantee (so far as possible).\n(3) However, for the purpose of assigning a risk weight to an exposure, its\nLTV ratio must be determined without taking any CRM technique into\naccount.\n4.4.62 Qualifying real estate exposures\nQualifying real estate exposures are classified according to whether\nrepayment is dependent on cash flows generated by the property, as\nfollows:\n(a) residential exposures repayment of which is not materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by the property;\n(b) residential exposures repayment of which is materially dependent\non cash flows generated by the property;\n(c) commercial exposures repayment of which is not materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by the property;\n(d) commercial exposures repayment of which is materially dependent\non cash flows generated by the property.\nNote 1 For the meaning of qualifying real estate exposure, see rule 4.4.55 (2).\nNote 2 For the meaning of materially dependent on cash flows generated by the\nproperty, see rule 4.4.65.\n4.4.63 Meaning of qualifying residential real estate exposure\nA qualifying residential real estate exposure is a qualifying real estate\nexposure that is secured on a property that has the nature of a dwelling\nand satisfies (or, for residential property under construction, will, when\ncompleted, satisfy) all the applicable laws and regulations to enable it to\nbe occupied for housing.\n4.4.64 Meaning of qualifying commercial real estate exposure\nA qualifying commercial real estate exposure is a qualifying real estate\nexposure that is not a qualifying residential real estate exposure.\n4.4.65 Meaning of materially dependent on cash flows generated\nby the property\n(1) A qualifying real estate exposure (whether residential or commercial) is\nmaterially dependent on cash flows generated by the property if the\npage 110 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.66\nborrower’s prospects of servicing the loan materially depend on the cash\nflows generated by the property that secures the loan rather than on the\nborrower’s capacity to do so from other sources (but see subrule (2)).\nGuidance\n1 The primary source of the cash flows generated by the property would generally\nbe lease or rental payments, or the sale of the property. The distinguishing\ncharacteristic of these exposures compared to other qualifying real estate\nexposures is that both the servicing of the loan and the prospects for recovery in\nthe event of default depend materially on the cash flows generated by the property\nsecuring the exposure.\n2 The material dependence condition set out above predominantly applies to loans\nto corporates or SPVs, but is not restricted to such borrowers. For example, a loan\nmight be considered materially dependent if more than 50% of the income from\nthe borrower used in the bank's assessment of its ability to service the loan is from\ncash flows generated by a residential property.\n(2) The following are exceptions to the general rule in subrule (1) (that is,\nthe following types of exposure are not treated as exposures the\nrepayment of which is materially dependent on cash flows generated by\nthe property that secures them):\n(a) exposures secured on a property that is the borrower’s primary\nresidence;\n(b) exposures, secured on an income-producing residential housing\nunit, to an individual who has mortgaged fewer than 50% of the\nproperties in the relevant development;\n(c) exposures, secured on residential real estate, to an association or\ncooperative of individuals:\n(i) that is regulated under national law; and\n(ii) whose only purpose is granting its members the use of a\nprimary residence in the property;\n(d) exposures, secured on residential real estate, to a public housing\ncompany or not-for-profit association that:\n(i) is regulated under national law; and\n(ii) exists to serve social purposes and to offer tenants long-term\nhousing.\n4.4.66 Risk weights — qualifying residential real estate\nexposures — not materially dependent on cash flows\ngenerated by property\nFor a qualifying residential real estate exposure that is not materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by the property, the risk weight to\nbe assigned to the total exposure amount is as set out in table 4.4.66.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 111\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule\nTable 4.4.66 Risk weights — qualifying residential real estate exposures not\nmaterially dependent on cash flows generated by property\nLTV ratio Risk weight (%)\n≤ 50% 20\n50% < LTV ≤ 60% 25\n60% < LTV ≤ 80% 30\n80% < LTV ≤ 90% 40\n90% < LTV ≤ 100% 50\n> 100% 70\n4.4.67 Risk weights — qualifying residential real estate\nexposures — materially dependent on cash flows\ngenerated by property\nFor a qualifying residential real estate exposure that is materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by the property, the risk weight to\nbe assigned to the total exposure amount is as set out in table 4.4.67.\nTable 4.4.67 Risk weights — qualifying residential real estate exposures materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by property\nLTV ratio Risk weight (%)\n≤ 50% 30\n50% < LTV ≤ 60% 35\n60% < LTV ≤ 80% 45\n80% < LTV ≤ 90% 60\n90% < LTV ≤ 100% 75\n> 100% 105\n4.4.68 Risk weights — qualifying commercial real estate\nexposures — not materially dependent on cash flows\ngenerated by property\n(1) For a qualifying commercial real estate exposure that is not materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by the property, the risk weight to\nbe assigned to the total exposure amount is as set out in table 4.4.68.\npage 112 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.69\nTable 4.4.68 Risk weights — qualifying commercial real estate exposures not\nmaterially dependent on cash flows generated by property\nLTV Risk weight (%)\n≤ 60% min {60, RW of counterparty}\n> 60% RW of counterparty\n(2) In table 4.4.68:\nRW of counterparty means the risk weight of the counterparty\nconcerned, as set out in rule 4.4.71.\n4.4.69 Risk weights — qualifying commercial real estate\nexposures — materially dependent on cash flows\ngenerated by property\nFor a qualifying commercial real estate exposure that is materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by the property, the risk weight to\nbe assigned to the total exposure amount is as set out in table 4.4.69.\nTable 4.4.69 Risk weights — qualifying commercial real estate exposures materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by property\nLTV Risk weight (%)\n≤ 60% 70\n60% <LTV ≤ 80% 90\n> 80% 110\n4.4.70 Risk weights — real estate exposures other than qualifying\nreal estate exposures\n(1) This rule applies to real estate exposures that are neither qualifying real\nestate exposures nor land acquisition, development and construction\nexposures.\n(2) The risk weight to be assigned to a real estate exposure to which this\nrule applies is:\n(a) if repayment of the exposure is not materially dependent on cash\nflows generated by the property — the risk weight of the\ncounterparty (see rule 4.4.71);

The use of CRM techniques\nmust be treated as complementary to, rather than a replacement for,\nthorough credit risk assessment.\nGuidance\nAlthough the use of CRM techniques reduces or transfers credit risk, it may at the\nsame time increase other risks (that is, residual risks). Residual risks include legal,\noperational, liquidity and market risks. Therefore, banking business firms must\nemploy robust procedures and processes to control such risks, including strategy;\nconsideration of the underlying credit; valuation; policies and procedures; systems;\ncontrol of roll-off risks; and management of concentration risk arising from the firm’s\nuse of CRM techniques and its interaction with the firm’s overall credit risk profile. If\nsuch risks are not adequately controlled, the Regulatory Authority may impose\nadditional capital charges or take other supervisory action.\nNote Under rule 4.4.5, if a claim or asset to which a banking business firm must\nassign a risk weight is secured by eligible collateral or a guarantee (or is\ncovered by a credit derivative or a netting agreement), the firm may apply\nthis Part to reduce the firm’s credit risk capital requirement.\n4.5.2 Choice of CRM techniques\n(1) CRM techniques include:\n(a) accepting collateral, standby letters of credit and guarantees;\n(b) using credit derivatives or other derivative instruments; and\n(c) using netting agreements.\nGuidance\n1 A banking business firm should not rely excessively on collateral or guarantees\nto mitigate credit risk. Although collateral or a guarantee may provide secondary\nprotection to the firm if the counterparty defaults, the primary consideration for\ncredit approval should be the counterparty’s ability to repay the loan.\n2 A banking business firm that provides mortgages at high LTV ratios should\nconsider the need for alternative forms of protection against the risks of such\nlending, including mortgage indemnity insurance, to protect itself against the risk\nof a fall in the value of the property.\n(2) In choosing a CRM technique, a banking business firm must consider:\n(a) the firm’s knowledge of the technique and its experience in using\nit;\n(b) the cost-effectiveness of the technique;\n(c) the type and financial strength of the counterparties or issuers;\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 125\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.5 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.5.3\n(d) the correlation of the technique with the underlying credits;\n(e) the availability, liquidity and realisability of the technique;\n(f) the extent to which documents in common use (for example, the\nISDA Master Agreement) can be adopted; and\n(g) the degree of recognition of the technique by financial services\nregulators.\n4.5.3 Requirements — use of CRM techniques\n(1) A banking business firm’s credit risk management policy must set out\nthe conditions under which CRM techniques may be used. The policy\nmust enable the firm to manage CRM techniques and the risks\nassociated with their use.\nNote For the general requirements about a firm’s credit risk management policy,\nsee Part 4.2.\n(2) The firm must analyse the protection given by any proposed CRM\ntechnique to ensure that any residual credit risk is identified, measured,\nevaluated, managed and either controlled or mitigated.\n(3) If the firm accepts collateral, its credit risk management policy must\nstate the types of collateral that it will accept, and the basis and\nprocedures for valuing collateral.\n(4) If the firm uses netting agreements, it must have a netting policy that\nsets out its approach to the use of such agreements. The policy must\nprovide for monitoring such agreements and must enable the firm to\nmonitor and report netted transactions on both gross and net bases.\n4.5.4 When CRM techniques reduce credit risk capital\nrequirement\n(1) A banking business firm’s use of a CRM technique reduces the firm’s\ncredit risk capital requirement only if the technique and every document\nthat gives effect to it is binding on all parties and is enforceable in all\nthe relevant jurisdictions.\nGuidance\nWhen accepting eligible collateral, a banking business firm must ensure that any\nnecessary legal procedures have been followed to ensure that the collateral can be\nenforced.\n(2) A banking business firm must review the enforceability of a CRM\ntechnique that it uses. The firm must have a well-founded legal basis for\npage 126 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.5\nRule 4.5.5\nany conclusion about enforceability, and must carry out further reviews\nto ensure that the technique remains enforceable.\nGuidance\nA banking business firm should consider whether independent legal advice should be\nsought on the enforceability of documents. The documents should be ready before the\nfirm enters into a contractual obligation or releases funds.\n(3) The effects of a CRM technique must not be double-counted. The firm’s\ncredit risk capital requirement is not reduced if:\n(a) the risk weight for a claim or asset is based on an issue-specific\nrating; and\n(b) the ECRA that determined the rating had taken the technique into\nconsideration in doing so.\n(4) A transaction in which CRM techniques are used must not receive a\nhigher capital requirement than an otherwise identical transaction in\nwhich no such technique is used.\n4.5.5 Use of 2 or more CRM techniques for 1 exposure etc\n(1) If a banking business firm has an exposure that is covered by 2 or more\nCRM techniques (for example, the exposure is covered by both eligible\ncollateral and an eligible guarantee), the firm must divide the exposure\ninto parts covered by each technique (for example, the part covered by\nthe collateral, and the part covered by the guarantee) and must calculate\nthe risk-weighted assets for each part separately.\n(2) If credit protection provided for an exposure by a single protection\nprovider has 2 or more maturities, the exposure must be divided into\nseparate parts for each maturity.\nDivision 4.5.B Collateral\nSubdivision 4.5.B.1 General\n4.5.6 Valuing collateral\nCollateral accepted by a banking business firm must be valued at its net\nrealisable value, taking into account the prevailing market conditions.\nThat value must be monitored at appropriate intervals, and the collateral\nmust be revalued regularly (at least annually).\nGuidance\n1 The net realisable value of some collateral may be readily available (for example,\ncollateral that is marked to market regularly). Other collateral may be more\ndifficult to value and may require knowledge and consideration of prevailing\nmarket conditions.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 127\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.5 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.5.7\n2 The method and frequency of monitoring and revaluation depend on the nature\nand condition of the collateral (see rule 4.5.12 (2)). For example, securities\naccepted as collateral are usually marked to market daily.\n4.5.7 Capital relief from collateral\n(1) Collateral reduces a banking business firm’s credit risk capital\nrequirement in relation to an exposure or exposures only if the collateral\nis eligible collateral.\nNote The capital relief that a banking business firm obtains from collateral is\ncalculated by either the simple approach (see Subdivision 4.5.B.2) or the\ncomprehensive approach (see Subdivision 4.5.B.3). The meaning of eligible\ncollateral differs between the simple approach and the comprehensive\napproach — see respectively rule 4.5.12 and rule 4.5.16.\n(2) Collateral may be lodged either by the firm’s counterparty, or by a third\nparty on the counterparty’s behalf.\n(3) The firm must enter into a written agreement with the party that lodges\nthe collateral. The agreement must establish the firm’s direct, explicit,\nirrevocable and unconditional recourse to the collateral.\nGuidance\nIn the case of cash collateral, the recourse may be in the form of a contractual right to\nset off credit balances. A common-law right of set-off does not, on its own, satisfy this\nrule.\n(4) If collateral is lodged by a third party, the third party must guarantee the\ncounterparty’s obligation to the firm and must indemnify the firm if the\ncounterparty fails to fulfil its obligation. The firm must ensure that the\nguarantee is legally enforceable.\n(5) The mechanism by which collateral is lodged must allow the firm to\nliquidate, or take possession of, the collateral in a timely way. The firm\nmust do everything necessary to satisfy the legal requirements\napplicable to its interest in the collateral.\nGuidance\n1 The firm should have clear and robust procedures for the liquidation of collateral\nto ensure that the legal conditions for declaring default and liquidating the\ncollateral are observed.\n2 The firm should consider whether, in the event of default, notice to the party that\nlodged the collateral would be needed before the firm could have recourse to it.\n(6) There must not be a significant positive correlation between the value\nof the collateral and the credit quality of the borrower.\nNote A positive correlation between the credit quality of the borrower and the\nvalue of the collateral is often called “wrong-way risk”.\npage 128 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.5\nRule 4.5.8\n4.5.8 Holding eligible collateral\n(1) Eligible collateral must be held by:\n(a) the banking business firm concerned;\n(b) a branch (in or outside the QFC) of the firm;\n(c) another member of the firm’s corporate group;\n(d) an independent custodian; or\n(e) a central counterparty.\n(2) The holder of cash collateral in the form of a certificate of deposit or\nbank bill issued by a banking business firm must keep possession of the\ninstrument while the collateralised exposure exists.\n(3) If the collateral is held by an independent custodian or central\ncounterparty, the firm must take reasonable steps to ensure that the\nholder segregates the collateral from the holder’s own assets.\n(4) If collateral is held by a branch of a banking business firm and the\nbranch is outside the QFC, the agreement between the firm and the party\nlodging the collateral must require the branch to act in accordance with\nthe agreement.\n4.5.9 Approaches to risk weight using eligible collateral\n(1) When assigning risk weights to exposures that are collateralised by\neligible collateral, a banking business firm may use either of the\nfollowing approaches:\n(a) the simple approach (see Subdivision 4.5.B.2);\n(b) the comprehensive approach (see Subdivision 4.5.B.3).\n(2) However, the firm must apply the same approach for all of the exposures\nin its banking book that are collateralised by eligible collateral.\n4.5.10 Definition for Division 4.5.B — core market participant\nIn this Division:\ncore market participant means any of the following:\n(a) the State of Qatar;\n(b) the Qatar Central Bank;\n(c) any other sovereign or central bank that qualifies for a 0% risk\nweight under Division 4.4.B;\n(d) a bank;\n(e) any other financial company (including an insurance company)\nthat qualifies for a 20% risk weight under Division 4.4.B;\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 129\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.5 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.5.11\n(f) a QCCP.\nSubdivision 4.5.B.2 Simple approach\nGuidance\nThe simple approach replaces the risk weight of the counterparty with the risk weight\nof the collateral (generally subject to a 20% minimum) for the collateralised part of\nthe exposure.\n4.5.11 When simple approach may be applied\n(1) For the simple approach to be applied, the collateral must be lodged for\nat least the life of the exposure, and must be marked to market at least\nonce a month. The release of collateral must be conditional on the\nrepayment of the exposure, but collateral may be reduced in proportion\nto the amount of any reduction in the exposure.\n(2) A banking business firm must not apply the simple approach if there is\na maturity mismatch between an exposure and its collateral.\n4.5.12 Eligible collateral in simple approach\n(1) In the simple approach, each of the following is eligible collateral:\n(a) gold bullion;\n(b) cash (including certificates of deposit and similar instruments\nissued by the banking business firm concerned);\n(c) debt securities of the following kinds:\n(i) issued by a sovereign or a non-commercial PSE that is rated,\nby an ECRA, at least BB- or higher;\n(ii) issued by an MDB that is eligible for 0% risk weight;\nNote For the list of such MDBs, see rule 4.4.16.\n(iii) short-term debt securities rated, by an ECRA, at A-3/P-3 or\nhigher;\n(iv) any other securities rated, by an ECRA, at BBB- or higher;\n(d) debt securities that have not been assigned an issue-specific rating\nby an ECRA, if:\n(i) the securities are issued by a bank (in or outside the QFC) as\nsenior debt and are listed on a recognised exchange;\nNote For the list of recognised exchanges, see Schedule 1.\n(ii) all rated issues of the same seniority issued by the bank are\nrated no lower than BBB- (for long-term instruments) or A-\n3/P-3 (for short-term instruments);

and\n(ii) the funds or UCITS are limited to investing in instruments\nlisted in this subrule.\n(2) Cash-funded credit-linked notes issued by the bank against exposures in\nthe banking book that fulfil the criteria for credit derivatives are treated\nas cash-collateralised transactions.\n(3) If a debt security issued by a rated sovereign does not have an issue-\nspecific rating, a banking business firm may treat the rating of the issuer\nas the rating of the security.\n(4) A re-securitisation is not eligible collateral.\n4.5.13 Risk weight for exposure collateralised by eligible\ncollateral — simple approach\n(1) Under the simple approach, the part of an exposure that is collateralised\nby eligible collateral must be assigned a risk weight of the higher of:\n(a) the risk weight of the collateral under Division 4.4.B; and\n(b) subject to the exceptions in subrules (3) to (8) — 20%.\n(2) Any part of the exposure that is not so collateralised must be assigned\nthe risk weight that would be assigned to an unsecured exposure to the\ncounterparty under Division 4.4.B.\n(3) Subrule (4) applies to an exposure of a banking business firm if:\n(a) the collateral is cash on deposit, or a certificate of deposit or similar\ninstrument issued by the firm;\n(b) the collateral:\n(i) is held at a third-party bank in a non-custodial arrangement;\nand\n(ii) is openly pledged to the firm;

The formula is in\nrule 4.5.19 (6).\n(3) In the case of a maturity mismatch, the value of the collateral must be\nadjusted in accordance with rule 4.5.20.\n(4) If the exposure and collateral are in different currencies, the firm must\napply an additional haircut to the volatility-adjusted collateral amount\nin accordance with rule 4.5.21 to take account of possible future\nfluctuations in exchange rates.\n(5) The effect of a netting agreement covering an SFT may be taken into\naccount in accordance with Division 4.5.E.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 133\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.5 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.5.16\n4.5.16 Eligible collateral in comprehensive approach\nIn the comprehensive approach, the following instruments may be\ntreated as eligible collateral in addition to the instruments mentioned in\nrule 4.5.12:\n(a) equities and convertible bonds that are not included in a main index\nbut are listed on a recognised exchange;\nNote For the list of recognised exchanges, see Schedule 1.\n(b) units in UCITS and mutual funds that include the instruments\nreferred to in paragraph (a).\n4.5.17 Calculation of exposure after risk mitigation —\ncomprehensive approach\n(1) The adjusted exposure value after risk mitigation is:\n𝐸∗ = 𝑚𝑎𝑥{0,(𝐸 ×(1+𝐻 )−𝐶 ×(1−𝐻 −𝐻 ))}\n𝑒 𝑐 𝑓𝑥\nwhere:\nE* is the adjusted exposure value after risk mitigation.\nE is the current marked-to-market value of the exposure.\nH is the haircut appropriate to the exposure (see rule 4.5.18).\ne\nC is the current marked-to-market value of the collateral.\nH is the haircut appropriate to the collateral (see rule 4.5.18).\nc\nH is the haircut appropriate for the currency mismatch between the\nfx\ncollateral and the exposure (see rule 4.5.21).\n(2) The risk-weighted asset amount for the collateralised transaction is:\nE* × RW;\nwhere:\nE* is the adjusted exposure value calculated in accordance with subrule\n(1).\nRW is the risk weight that would be assigned, under Division 4.4.B, to\nan unsecured exposure to the counterparty.\n4.5.18 Haircuts to be applied to exposure and collateral\n(1) The standard haircuts to be applied to exposures or eligible collateral\nare set out in tables 4.5.18A and 4.5.18B.

The framework for collateral haircuts distinguishes between SFTs, other\ncapital markets-driven transactions (that is, OTC derivatives transactions and margin\nlending) and secured lending. In capital-market-driven transactions and repo-style\ntransactions, the documentation contains remargining clauses; in secured lending\ntransactions, it generally does not.\nTable 4.5.19 Minimum holding periods and conditions\nTransaction type Minimum holding Condition\nperiod\nSFTs 5 business days Daily remargining\nOther capital market 10 business days Daily remargining\ntransactions\nSecured lending 20 business days Daily revaluation\n(2) However, if a netting set includes both SFTs and other capital market\ntransactions, the minimum holding period of 10 business days must be\nused.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 137\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.5 Credit risk mitigation\nRule -\n(3) Also, a minimum holding period of 20 business days must be used in\nthe following cases:\n(a) if in a quarter the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000\nat any time — in the next quarter;\n(b) for a netting set that includes 1 or more trades involving illiquid\ncollateral.\n(4) For paragraph (3) (b), whether collateral is illiquid must be determined\nin the context of stressed market conditions. Collateral is illiquid if there\nis no continuously active market in which a counterparty would, within\n2 days or less, obtain multiple price quotations that would not move the\nmarket or reflect a market discount.\nGuidance\nExamples of collateral that would be considered illiquid include:\n• collateral that is not marked to market daily\n• collateral that is subject to a particular accounting treatment for valuation\npurposes (for example, SFTs referencing securities whose fair value is\ndetermined by models with inputs that are not observed in the market).\n(5) If on a particular netting set, over the previous 2 quarters, a banking\nbusiness firm has experienced more than 2 margin call disputes that\nhave lasted longer than the firm’s estimate of the margin period of risk\n(that is, the period from the last exchange of collateral covering the\nnetting set with a defaulting counterparty until the counterparty is closed\nout and the resulting market risk is rehedged) then, for the following 2\nquarters, the firm must use a minimum holding period that is twice the\nperiod that would apply except for this subrule.\n(6) When remargining or revaluation is undertaken less frequently than the\nminimum specified in table 4.5.19, the haircut that must be applied is:\n𝑁 +(𝑇 −1)\n𝑅 𝑀\n𝐻 = 𝐻 √\n+ M T\n𝑀\nwhere:\nH is the haircut to be applied.\n+\nH is the haircut under the minimum holding period.\nM\nN is the actual number of business days between remarginings (for\nR\ncapital market transactions) or revaluations (for secured transactions).\nT is the minimum holding period for transactions of that type, as set\nM\nout in table 4.5.19.\npage 138 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.5\nRule 4.5.20\n(7) However, the firm may apply a haircut of 0% to an SFT with a core\nmarket participant, if the transaction satisfies all of the conditions in rule\n4.5.13 (5).\n4.5.20 Treatment of maturity mismatches\n(1) A maturity mismatch exists between an exposure and its credit risk\nmitigation if the residual maturity of the term of lodgement of the credit\nrisk mitigation is shorter than the maturity of the exposure.\n(2) The maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the credit risk\nmitigation must both be defined conservatively. The effective maturity\nof the underlying must be taken to be the longest possible remaining\ntime before the counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its obligation, taking\ninto account any applicable grace period. For the credit risk mitigation,\nembedded options that may reduce the term of the credit risk mitigation\nmust be taken into account so that the shortest possible effective\nmaturity is used.\nGuidance\nFor example: if, in the case of a credit derivative, the protection seller has a call option,\nthe maturity is the first call date. Likewise, if the protection buyer owns the call option\nand has a strong incentive to call the transaction at the first call date, for example\nbecause of a step-up in cost from that date on, the effective maturity is the remaining\ntime to the first call date.\n(3) If there is a maturity mismatch, the credit risk mitigation may be\nrecognised only if the original maturity of its term of lodgement is\n12 months or longer, and its residual maturity is 3 months or longer.\n(4) For the purpose of determining the maturity of the exposure and credit\nrisk mitigation:\n(a) for the exposure, the effective maturity is taken to be the longest\npossible remaining time before the counterparty must fulfil its\nobligation; and\n(b) for the credit risk mitigation, the banking business firm concerned\nmust take into account any provision or incentive within the\ndocumentation for the transaction that could reduce the term of the\ncredit risk mitigation, so that the shortest possible effective\nmaturity is used.\n(5) If there is a maturity mismatch, the firm must adjust the value of the\ncredit risk mitigation as follows:\n𝑡 −0.25\n𝑃 = 𝑃 ×\n𝑎 𝑇−0.25\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 139\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.5 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.5.21\nwhere:\nP is the value of the credit risk mitigation, adjusted for the maturity\na\nmismatch.\nP is the value of the credit risk mitigation after adjustment for any\nhaircuts.\nt is min {T, residual maturity of the credit risk mitigation arrangement},\nin years.\nT is min {5 years, residual maturity of the exposure}, in years.\n4.5.21 Treatment of currency mismatches\n(1) A currency mismatch exists between an exposure and its credit risk\nmitigation if the credit risk mitigation is denominated in a different\ncurrency from the one in which the exposure is denominated. If so, the\namount G of the exposure that may be treated as protected by the credit\nA\nrisk mitigation is:\n𝐺 = 𝐺 ×(1−𝐻 )\n𝐴 𝐹𝑋\nwhere:\nG is the nominal amount of the credit risk mitigation.\nH is the haircut appropriate for the currency mismatch (see\nFX\nsubrule (2)).\n(2) The haircut for a 10-business-day holding period (assuming daily\nmarking to market) is 8%.

or\n(b) the firm represents that it does not intend to, and will not, re-use\nthem in that way.\n4.5.24 SFTs that must be treated as unsecured loans\n(1) An SFT to which rule 4.5.23 (2) applies (in-scope SFT) that does not\nmeet the haircut minimum in table 4.5.23 must be treated as an\nunsecured loan to the counterparty.\n(2) To determine whether subrule (1) applies to an in-scope SFT (or a\nnetting set of such SFTs in the case of a portfolio-level haircut), a\nbanking business firm must compare the collateral haircut H (real or\ncalculated in accordance with subrules (3) and (4)) and a haircut\nminimum f (from table 4.5.23 or calculated in accordance with subrules\n(3) and (4)).\n(3) For a single in-scope SFT not included in a netting set, the values of H\nand f are as follows:\n(a) for a single cash-lent-for-collateral SFT, H is the amount of\ncollateral received and f is as given in table 4.5.23 (for the purposes\nof this calculation, collateral that is called by either counterparty\ncan be treated as collateral received from the moment that it is\ncalled — that is, the treatment is independent of the settlement\nperiod);\nGuidance\nFor example, consider an in-scope SFT where 100 cash is lent against 101 of a\ncorporate debt security with a 12-year maturity. H is 1% [(101-100)/100] and f\nis 4% (from table 4.5.23). Therefore, the SFT in question must be treated as an\nunsecured loan to the counterparty.\n(b) for a single collateral-for-collateral SFT, lending collateral A and\nreceiving collateral B, H is still the amount of collateral received\nbut the effective minimum of the transaction f must integrate the\nminima of both types of collateral and must be calculated by the\nformula:\n1+𝑓\n𝐵\n𝑓 = −1\n1+𝑓\n𝐴\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 143\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.5 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.5.24\nand then compared to the effective haircut of the transaction,\ncalculated by the formula\n𝐶𝐵\n−1.\n𝐶𝐴\nGuidance\nFor example, consider an in-scope SFT where 102 of a corporate debt security\nwith a 10-year maturity is exchanged against 104 of equity, the effective haircut\nH of the transaction is (104/102 – 1 = 1.96% which must be compared with the\neffective minimum f of 1.06/1.03 – 1 = 2.91%. Therefore, the SFT in question\nmust be treated as an unsecured loan to the counterparty.\n(4) For a netting set of SFTs, the formula for the effective “portfolio”\nminimum for the transaction is:\n𝑓 = [(\n∑𝑠𝐸𝑠\n)/(\n∑𝑡𝐶𝑡\n)] - 1\n𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑜\n∑𝑠𝐸𝑠 𝑥 ( 1+𝑓𝑠) ∑𝑡𝐶𝑡 𝑥 ( 1+𝑓𝑡)\nwhere:\nE is the net position in each security (or cash) that is net lent.\ns\nC isthe net position that is net borrowed.\nt\nf and f are the respective haircut minima for the securities that are net\ns t\nlent and net borrowed.\n(5) The result of the calculation in subrule (4) is the weighted average\nminimum of the portfolio. The portfolio haircut does not breach the\nminimum if:\n∑𝐶 −∑𝐸\n𝑡 𝑠\n≥ 𝑓\n∑𝐸 𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑜\n𝑠\n(6) If the portfolio haircut is below the minimum, then the netting set of\nSFTs must be treated as an unsecured loan to the counterparty. That\ntreatment must be applied to all trades in which:\n(a) the security received appears in table 4.5.23; and\n(b) within the netting set, the firm is a net receiver of that security.\n(7) For the purposes of the calculation, collateral that is called by either\ncounterparty can be treated as collateral received from the moment that\nit is called (that is, the treatment is independent of the settlement period).\nGuidance\nThe following portfolio of trades gives an example of how this method works (it shows\na portfolio that does not breach the minimum).\nActual trades Cash Sovereign debt Collateral A Collateral B\nMinimum (fs) 0% 0% 6% 10%\nPortfolio of trades 50 100 -400 250\nEs 50 100 0 250\npage 144 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.5\nRule 4.5.25\nActual trades Cash Sovereign debt Collateral A Collateral B\nCt 0 0 400 0\nfportfolio -0.0024\n∑𝐶 −∑𝐸 0\n𝑡 𝑠\n∑𝐸\n𝑠\nDivision 4.5.C Guarantees\n4.5.25 Capital relief from guarantees\n(1) A guarantee reduces a banking business firm’s credit risk capital\nrequirement in relation to an exposure only if:\n(a) the guarantor is an eligible guarantor (see rule 4.5.26);\n(b) the guarantee is an eligible guarantee (see rule 4.5.27); and\n(c) an unsecured exposure to the guarantor would be assigned a lower\nrisk weight than an unsecured exposure to the counterparty.\n(2) Before accepting a guarantee, a banking business firm must consider the\nguarantor’s legal and financial ability to fulfil the guarantee.\n4.5.26 Eligible guarantors\nEach of the following is an eligible guarantor:\n(a) the State of Qatar or any other sovereign;\n(b) a PSE or MDB;\n(c) a bank, securities firm or other financial institution that is\nprudentially regulated to a standard similar to that applied by the\nRegulatory Authority;\n(d) if the relevant exposure is a securitisation exposure — an\nexternally-rated entity (including a parent, subsidiary or affiliate of\nthe obligor) that is rated BBB- or better and was rated A- or better\nwhen the guarantee was given;\n(e) if the relevant exposure is not a securitisation exposure — any\nexternally-rated entity, including a parent, subsidiary or affiliate of\nthe obligor.\n4.5.27 What is an eligible guarantee?\n(1) A guarantee is an eligible guarantee if it satisfies subrules (2) to (10).\n(2) The guarantor is an eligible guarantor.\n(3) The guarantee is explicitly documented.\n(4) The guarantee is a direct claim on the guarantor and clearly states the\nextent of the cover.

In a securitisation, payments to the investors\ndepend on the performance of the underlying pool of assets, rather than\non an obligation of the originator of the assets.\n(2) The underlying pool in a securitisation may include 1 or more\nexposures.\n(3) The securities usually take the form of bonds, notes, pass-through\nsecurities, collateralised debt obligations or even equity securities that\nare structured into different classes (tranches) with different payment\npriorities, degrees of credit risk and return characteristics.\nNote A securitisation (whether traditional or synthetic) must have at least\n2 tranches (see subrules 4.6.3 (2) and (3)).\n(4) Re-securitisation is a securitisation in which at least one of the\nunderlying assets is itself a securitisation or another re-securitisation.\nNote Exposures arising from re-tranching are not re-securitisation exposures if,\nafter the re-tranching, the exposures act like direct tranching of a pool with\nno securitised assets. This means that the cash flows to and from the firm as\noriginator could be replicated in all circumstances and conditions by an\nexposure to the securitisation of a pool of assets that contains no\nsecuritisation exposures.\n(5) A reference in this Part to securitisation includes re-securitisation.\n4.6.3 Securitisation structures\n(1) A securitisation may be a traditional securitisation or a synthetic\nsecuritisation.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 161\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 4.6.4\n(2) In a traditional securitisation, title to the underlying assets is\ntransferred to an SPE, and the cash flows from the underlying pool of\nassets are used to service at least 2 tranches. A traditional securitisation\ngenerally assumes the movement of assets off the originator’s balance-\nsheet.\n(3) A synthetic securitisation is a securitisation with at least 2 tranches that\nreflect different degrees of credit risk where the credit risk of the\nunderlying pool of exposures is transferred, in whole or in part, through\nthe use of credit derivatives or guarantees. In a synthetic securitisation,\nthe third party to whom the risk is transferred need not be an SPE.\nGuidance\nThe Regulatory Authority would treat as securitisations other structures designed to\nfinance assets that are legally transferred to a scheme by packaging them into tradeable\nsecurities secured on the assets and serviced from their related cash flows.\nFunded credit derivatives would include credit-linked notes, and unfunded credit\nderivatives would include credit default swaps.\n4.6.4 Securitisation exposures\nA securitisation exposure of a banking business firm is a risk position\n(whether on-balance-sheet or off-balance-sheet) held by the firm arising\nfrom a securitisation.\nExamples of sources\n• investments in a securitisation\n• asset-backed securities (including mortgage-backed securities)\n• credit enhancements and liquidity facilities\n• interest rate swaps and currency swaps\n• credit derivatives\n• corporate bonds, equity securities and private equity investments\n• reserve accounts (such as cash collateral accounts) recorded as assets by a firm\nthat is, or that acts in the capacity of, an originator.\n4.6.5 Parties to securitisation\nFor purposes of calculating a banking business firm’s capital\nrequirements, the parties to a securitisation are the originator, the issuer\nand the investors.\nNote 1 Depending on the securitisation structure, a banking business firm may be\n(or act in the capacity of) originator, issuer, investor or any 1 or more of the\nfollowing:\n(a) a manager of the securitisation;\n(b) a sponsor of the securitisation;\n(c) an adviser to the securitisation;\n(d) an entity to place the securities with investors;\npage 162 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.6\n(e) a provider of credit enhancement;\n(f) a provider of a liquidity facility;\n(g) a servicer to carry out certain activities usually carried out by the\nmanager of the securitisation in relation to the underlying assets.\nNote 2 A banking business firm may act as sponsor of a securitisation or similar\nprogramme involving assets of a customer. As sponsor, the firm earns fees\nto manage or advise on the programme, place the securities with investors,\nprovide credit enhancement or provide a liquidity facility.\n4.6.6 Firm as originator\nA banking business firm is an originator of a securitisation if:\n(a) the firm originates, directly or indirectly, underlying assets\nincluded in the securitisation; or\n(b) the firm serves as sponsor of an asset-backed commercial paper\nprogramme (or similar programme) that acquires exposures from\nthird parties.\nGuidance\n1 In relation to a programme that acquires exposures from third parties, a\nbanking business firm would generally be considered a sponsor (and,\ntherefore, an originator) if the firm, in fact or in substance, manages or\nadvises the programme, places securities into the market, provides a\nliquidity facility or provides a credit enhancement.\n2 Acts of management would include handling related taxes, managing\nescrow accounts, remitting payments and obtaining insurance.\nDivision 4.6.B Securitisation process\n4.6.7 Process of securitisation\n(1) The process of a securitisation is:\n(a) first, the origination of assets or credit risk;\n(b) second, the transfer of the assets or credit risk; and\n(c) third, the issuance of securities to investors.\n(2) In a securitisation, the cash flow from the pool is used to make payments\non obligations to at least 2 tranches or classes of investors (typically\nholders of debt securities), with each tranche or class being entitled to\nreceive payments from the pool before or after another tranche or class\nof investors, so that the tranches or classes bear different levels of credit\nrisk.\n4.6.8 Special purpose entities\n(1) A special purpose entity (or SPE) is a legal entity that is created solely\nfor a particular financial transaction or series of transactions. The SPE\nmust not engage in any other business.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 163\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 4.6.9\n(2) In a securitisation, an SPE typically purchases and holds the assets for\nthe purposes of the securitisation. The SPE’s payment for the pool is\ntypically funded by debt, including through the issue of securities by the\nSPE.\nGuidance\nThe purpose of the SPE to facilitate the securitisation, and the extent of a banking\nbusiness firm’s involvement in the SPE, should be clear. The SPE’s activities should\nbe limited to those necessary to accomplish that purpose.\n(3) Most securitisations require the creation of an SPE to:\n(a) hold the assets transferred by the originator;\n(b) issue securities based on the assets; and\n(c) act as intermediary between the originator and the investors.\nNote A synthetic securitisation may or may not require an SPE (see\nsubrule 4.6.3 (3))\n(4) An SPE may take the form of a limited partnership, limited liability\ncompany, corporation, trust or collective investment fund. An SPE may\nalso be established under a special law that allows the creation of SPEs.\nGuidance\nBy its nature, an SPE is a legal shell with only the specific assets transferred by the\noriginator (that is, the SPE has no other property in which any other party could have\nan interest).\n(5) An SPE must be bankruptcy-remote from the originator. It must not be\nconsolidated with the originator for tax, accounting or legal purposes.\n(6) Any undertaking given by a banking business firm to an SPV must be\nstated clearly in the transaction documents for the securitisation.\nDivision 4.6.C Risk management of securitisation\n4.6.9 Role of governing body—securitisation\n(1) A banking business firm’s governing body must oversee the firm’s\nsecuritisation exposures.\n(2) The governing body:\n(a) must understand, and set the scope and purpose of, the firm’s\nsecuritisations; and\n(b) must be aware of the risks and other implications associated with\nsecuritisation.\npage 164 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.10\n(3) The governing body must ensure that the firm’s senior management\nestablishes and implements securitisation policies that include:\n(a) appropriate risk management systems to identify, measure,\nmonitor, report on and control or mitigate the risks arising from\nthe firm’s involvement in securitisation; and\n(b) how the firm monitors, and reports on, the effect of securitisation\non its risk profile.\n4.6.10 Relation to internal capital adequacy assessment\nA banking business firm must be able to demonstrate to the Regulatory\nAuthority that the firm’s ICAAP captures the following specific risks\nrelating to securitisation:\n(a) credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and reputation risk for each\nsecuritisation exposure;\n(b) potential delinquencies and losses on the exposures;\n(c) risks arising from the provision of credit enhancements and\nliquidity facilities; and\n(d) risks arising from guarantees provided by monoline insurers and\nother third parties.\nNote The due diligence requirements in rule 4.6.18 (3) require a banking business\nfirm to have policies:\n(a) to ensure that the economic substance of each securitisation is taken\ninto account in managing the risks arising from the firm’s\ninvolvement in securitisation;\n(b) to document its systems and controls in relation to securitisation and\nthe risks that arise from it; and\n(c) that set out the effects of securitisation on capital.\nDivision 4.6.D Operational requirements for using\nexternal ratings\n4.6.11 External credit rating agencies\n(1) Depending on the securitisation structure, 1 or more ECRAs may be\ninvolved in rating the securitisation. A banking business firm must use\nonly ECRAs that have a demonstrated expertise in assessing\nsecuritisations.\nGuidance\nExpertise might be evidenced by strong market acceptance.\n(2) For the purposes of risk-weighting, an ECRA must take into account the\ntotal amount of the firm’s exposure on all payments owed to it. For\nexample, if the firm is owed principal and interest, the ECRA’s\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 165\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 4.6.12\nassessment must have taken into account timely repayment of both\nprincipal and interest.\nNote For the use of ECRAs in general, see Part 4.3.\n4.6.12 Ratings must be publicly available\n(1) A credit rating assigned by an ECRA must be publicly available. If the\nrating assigned to a facility is not publicly available, the facility must be\ntreated as unrated.\nNote For the treatment of an eligible liquidity facility whose rating is not publicly\navailable, see rule 4.6.30.\n(2) The loss and cash flow analysis for the securitisation, and the sensitivity\nof the rating to changes in the assumptions on which it was made, must\nalso be publicly available.\nGuidance\nInformation required under this rule should be published in an accessible form for free.\nInformation that is made available only to the parties to a securitisation is not\nconsidered publicly available.\n4.6.13 Ratings must be applied consistently\n(1) A credit rating assigned by an ECRA must be applied consistently\nacross all tranches of a securitisation.\n(2) A banking business firm must not use an ECRA’s credit rating for 1 or\nmore tranches and another ECRA’s rating for other tranches within the\nsame securitisation structure (whether or not those other tranches are\nrated by the first ECRA).\nNote Under rule 4.3.6:\n(a) if there are 2 different assessments by ECRAs, the higher risk-weight\nmust be applied; and\n(b) if there are 3 or more different assessments by ECRAs, the\nassessments corresponding to the 2 lowest risk-weights should be\nreferred to and the higher of those 2 risk-weights must be applied.\nDivision 4.6.E Calculation of risk-weighted assets\n4.6.14 Operational requirements for traditional securitisation\nA banking business firm that is an originator or sponsor of a traditional\nsecuritisation may exclude, from the calculation of its risk-weighted\nassets, exposures relating to the securitised assets only if:\n(a) the immediate transferee of the underlying assets is an SPE, and\nthe holders of the legal or beneficial interests in the SPE have the\nright to pledge or exchange those interests without restriction;\npage 166 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.14\n(b) substantially all credit risk associated with the securitised assets\nhave been transferred;\n(c) the firm has no direct or indirect control over the securitised assets;\nGuidance about control\n1 A banking business firm would be taken to maintain effective control over\ntransferred credit risk exposures if:\n(a) the firm is able to repurchase from the transferee the transferred\nexposures in order to realise their benefits; or\n(b) the firm is obligated to retain the risk of the exposures.\n2 A firm that is an originator may act as servicer of the underlying assets,\nand the firm’s retention of servicing rights would not necessarily constitute\nindirect control over the assets.\n(d) the securitised assets are legally isolated from the firm (through\nthe sale of the assets or through sub-participation) so that the assets\nare beyond the reach of the firm and its creditors even in case of\nbankruptcy or insolvency;\n(e) a qualified legal counsel (whether external or in-house) has given\na written reasoned opinion that paragraph (d) is satisfied;\n(f) any clean-up call complies with rule 4.6.16;\n(g) the securities issued are not obligations of the firm, so that\ninvestors have a claim only on the securitised assets and have no\nclaim against the firm;\n(h) the securitisation does not include any term or condition that:\n(i) requires the firm to alter the underlying exposures to improve\nthe pool’s weighted average credit quality (unless the\nimprovement is achieved by selling exposures at market\nprices to parties who are neither affiliated, connected or\nrelated to the firm);\nNote Affiliate, connected and related party are defined in the\nglossary.\n(ii) allows increases in a retained first loss position or credit\nenhancement; or\n(iii) increases the yield payable to parties other than the firm (for\nexample, payments to investors and providers of credit\nenhancement) in response to a deterioration in the credit\nquality of the underlying assets; and\n(i) the securitisation does not have:\n(i) termination provisions for specific changes in tax and\nregulation;\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 167\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 4.6.15\n(iii) termination options or triggers (except clean-up calls that\ncomply with rule 4.6.16); or\n(iii) early amortisation provisions that, under rule 4.6.38, would\nresult in the securitisation not meeting the other requirements\nin paragraphs (a) to (h).\nNote Under rule 4.6.20, an originator that meets the requirements set out in this\nrule must, however, hold regulatory capital against any exposures that it\nretains in relation to the securitisation (including exposures arising from the\nprovision of credit enhancements and liquidity facilities).\n4.6.15 Operational requirements for synthetic securitisation\nIn calculating its risk-weighted assets, a banking business firm that is an\noriginator or sponsor of a synthetic securitisation may exclude\nsecuritised exposures only if:\n(a) substantially all credit risk associated with the securitised\nexposures have been transferred;\n(b) the CRM technique used to obtain capital relief is eligible\ncollateral, an eligible credit derivative, a guarantee or an eligible\nnetting agreement;\nNote Eligible collateral pledged by an SPE in a securitisation may be\nrecognised as a CRM technique, but an SPE of a securitisation cannot\nbe an eligible protection provider in the securitisation (see rule 4.6.32\n(2)).\n(c) the securitisation does not include any terms or conditions that\nlimit the amount of credit risk transferred, such as clauses that:\n(i) materially limit the credit protection or credit risk\ntransference (including clauses that provide significant\nmateriality thresholds below which credit protection is not to\nbe triggered even if a credit event occurs and clauses that\nallow termination of the protection because of deterioration\nin the credit quality of the underlying exposures);\n(ii) require the firm to alter the underlying exposures to improve\nthe pool’s weighted average credit quality;\n(iii) increase the firm’s cost of credit protection to the firm in\nresponse to a deterioration in the credit quality of the\nunderlying exposures;\n(iv) allow increases in a retained first loss position or credit\nenhancement; or\n(v) increase the yield payable to parties other than the firm (for\nexample, payments to investors and providers of credit\npage 168 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.16\nenhancement) in response to a deterioration in the credit\nquality of the underlying exposures;\n(d) a qualified legal counsel (whether external or in-house) has given\na written reasoned opinion that paragraph (c) is satisfied and that\nthe contract for the transfer of the credit risk is enforceable in all\nrelevant jurisdictions;\n(e) any clean-up call complies with rule 4.6.16; and\n(f) if the credit risk associated with the securitised exposures is\ntransferred to an SPE:\n(i) the securities issued by the SPE are not obligations of the\nfirm;\n(ii) the holders of the beneficial interests in the SPE have the\nright to pledge or exchange those interests without\nrestriction; and\n(iii) the firm holds no more than 20% of the aggregate original\namount of all securities issued by the SPE, unless:\n(A) the holdings consist entirely of securities that are rated\nAAA to AA- (long term) or A-1 (short term); and\n(B) all transactions with the SPE are at arm’s length and on\nmarket terms and conditions.\nNote Under rule 4.6.20, an originator or sponsor that meets the requirements set\nout in this rule must, however, hold regulatory capital against any exposures\nthat it retains in relation to the securitisation (including exposures arising\nfrom the provision of credit enhancements and liquidity facilities).\n4.6.16 Requirements for clean-up calls—traditional and synthetic\nsecuritisations\n(1) A clean-up call is an option that permits the securitisation exposures to\nbe called before all of the underlying exposures or securitisation\nexposures have been repaid.\n(2) There is no capital requirement for a securitisation that includes a clean-\nup call, if:\n(a) the exercise of the clean-up call is at the discretion of the originator\nor sponsor;\n(b) the clean-up call is not structured:\n(i) to avoid allocating losses to credit enhancements or positions\nheld by investors; or\n(ii) to provide credit enhancement; and\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 169\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 4.6.17\n(c) the clean-up call may only be exercised:\n(i) for a traditional securitisation—when 10% or less of the\noriginal underlying pool of assets, or securities issued,\nremains; or\n(ii) for a synthetic securitisation—when 10% or less of the\noriginal reference portfolio value remains.\nGuidance\n1 For a traditional securitisation, a clean-up call might be carried out by\nrepurchasing the remaining securitisation exposures after the balance of the pool\nhas, or the outstanding securities have, fallen below a specified level.\n2 For a synthetic securitisation, a clean-up call might take the form of a clause that\nextinguishes the credit protection.\n4.6.17 Clean-up calls that fail requirements—traditional and\nsynthetic securitisations\n(1) This rule applies to a securitisation that includes a clean-up call if the\nclean-up call does not comply with all of the operational requirements\nin rule 4.6.16.\n(2) The originator or sponsor must calculate a capital requirement for the\nsecuritisation.\nNote If the clean-up call is exercised and found to serve as a credit enhancement,\nthe exercise of the call must be considered as implicit support and treated in\naccordance with rule 4.6.21.\n(3) For a traditional securitisation, the underlying assets must be treated as\nif they were not securitised. No gain-on-sale of those assets may be\nrecognised.\n(4) For a synthetic securitisation, a banking business firm that purchases\nprotection must hold capital against the entire amount of the securitised\nexposures as if they did not benefit from any credit protection.\n4.6.18 Due diligence requirements\n(1) A banking business firm must not apply a risk-weight to a securitisation\nexposure using table 4.6.22, unless the firm meets the requirements set\nout in subrules (3) to (7) (the due diligence requirements).\n(2) If the firm fails to meet a due diligence requirement in relation to a\nsecuritisation exposure, the Regulatory Authority may direct the firm:\n(a) to apply a risk-weight of 1,250% to the exposure; or\n(b) to deduct the amount of the exposure from its regulatory capital.\npage 170 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.19\n(3) The firm must have, in relation to securitisation, appropriate policies:\n(a) to ensure that the economic substance of each securitisation is\ntaken into account in managing the risks arising from the firm’s\ninvolvement in securitisation;\n(b) to document its systems and controls in relation to securitisation\nand the risks that arise from it; and\n(c) that set out the effects of securitisation on capital.\n(4) The firm must have, on an ongoing basis, a clear understanding of the\nrisk characteristics of its individual securitisation exposures (whether\non-balance-sheet or off-balance-sheet) and the risk characteristics of the\npool underlying those exposures.\n(5) The firm must understand, at all times, the structural features that may\nmaterially affect the performance of its securitisation exposures (such\nas contractual waterfall and waterfall-related triggers, credit\nenhancements, liquidity facilities, market value triggers, and deal-\nspecific definitions of default).\n(6) The firm must have continuous access to performance information\nabout its underlying assets.\nNote Performance information may include exposure type, percentage of loans\n30, 60 and 90 days past due, default rates, prepayment rates, loans in\nforeclosure, property type, occupancy, average credit score or other\nmeasures of creditworthiness, average loan-to-value ratio, and industry\ndiversification and geographic diversification.\n(7) For re-securitisation, the firm must have not only information on the\nsecuritisation tranches (such as the issuer name and credit quality) but\nalso the characteristics and performance of the pools underlying those\ntranches.\n4.6.19 Capital treatment to be based on economic substance\n(1) The capital treatment of a securitisation exposure must be determined\non the basis of the economic substance, rather than the legal form, of\nthe securitisation structure. If a banking business firm is uncertain about\nwhether a transaction is a securitisation, the firm must consult with the\nRegulatory Authority.\n(2) Despite anything in these rules, the Regulatory Authority may look\nthrough the structure to the economic substance of the transaction, and:\n(a) vary the capital treatment of a securitisation exposure; or\n(b) reclassify a transaction as a securitisation or not a securitisation,\nand impose a capital requirement or limit on the transaction.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 171\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 4.6.20\nDivision 4.6.F Capital requirements where firm is\noriginator or sponsor\n4.6.20 Retained securitisation exposures\n(1) A banking business firm that is an originator or sponsor of a\nsecuritisation might, despite having transferred the underlying assets or\nthe credit risk to those assets, continue to be exposed (through retained\nsecuritisation exposures) in relation to the securitisation. The firm must\nhold regulatory capital against all of its retained securitisation\nexposures.\n(2) The sources of retained securitisation exposures include:\n(a) investments in the securitisation (including the investment\nrequired under subrule (3));\n(b) investments in asset-backed securities (including mortgage-\nbacked securities);\n(c) retention of a subordinated tranche;\n(d) credit enhancements provided by the firm; and\n(e) liquidity facilities provided by the firm.\nA repurchased securitisation exposure must be treated as a retained\nsecuritisation exposure.\nNote 1 For paragraph (a), the exposure arising from investments by a banking\nbusiness firm in a securitisation originated by the firm is an on-balance-sheet\nexposure.\nNote 2 For paragraphs (d) and (e), the exposures arising from the provision of credit\nenhancements and liquidity facilities by a banking business firm in relation\nto a securitisation originated by the firm are off-balance-sheet exposures.\n(3) A banking business firm that is an originator or sponsor of a\nsecuritisation must retain 5% of the total issuance.\nNote Under rule 3.2.29, a banking business firm must derecognise, in its\ncalculation of CET 1, any increase in equity capital or CET 1 capital from a\ngain-on-sale in a securitisation transaction.\n4.6.21 Effect of giving implicit support\nA banking business firm that gives implicit support to a securitisation:\n(a) must include the underwriting exposures of the securitisation in its\ncalculation of risk-weighted assets (as if those assets had not been\nsecuritised and had remained on its balance sheet);\n(b) must not recognise any gain-on-sale of the underlying assets; and\n(c) must disclose to investors that it has provided implicit support and\nthe effect on regulatory capital of doing so.\npage 172 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.22\n4.6.22 Treatment of on-balance-sheet retained securitisation\nexposures\n(1) The risk-weighted asset amount of an on-balance-sheet retained\nsecuritisation exposure is calculated by multiplying the exposure by the\napplicable risk-weight in table 4.6.22.\nTable 4.6.22 Risk-weights based on ECRA rating\nNote In the table, the ratings are given according to Standard & Poor’s\nconventions.

The firm need\nnot consider any interest rate or currency swap when determining\nwhether an exposure is the most senior in a securitisation.\n(2) In the look-through treatment, the unrated most senior position receives,\nsubject to the Regulatory Authority’s review, the average risk-weight of\nthe underlying exposures.\n4.6.25 Treatment of second loss position in ABCP programmes\n(1) This rule applies to an unrated securitisation exposure in an ABCP\nprogramme if:\n(a) the exposure is economically in a second loss position or better and\nthe first loss position provides significant credit protection to the\nsecond loss position;\n(b) the associated credit risk is the equivalent of investment grade or\nbetter; and\n(c) the banking business firm holding the exposure does not retain or\nprovide the first loss position.\npage 174 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.26\n(2) An unrated securitisation exposure arising from a second loss position\n(or better position) is subject to a risk-weight of the higher of:\n(a) 100%; and\n(b) the highest risk-weight applicable to an underlying exposure\ncovered by the facility.\n4.6.26 Treatment of overlapping exposures\n(1) Overlapping exposures may result if a banking business firm provides 2\nor more facilities (such as liquidity facilities and credit enhancements)\nin relation to a securitisation that can be drawn under various conditions\nwith different triggers. In effect, the firm provides duplicate cover to the\nunderlying exposures.\n(2) For the purposes of calculating its capital requirements, a banking\nbusiness firm’s exposure (exposure A) overlaps another exposure\n(exposure B) if in all circumstances the firm will preclude any loss to it\non exposure B by fulfilling its obligations with respect to exposure A.\nExample\nIf, under exposure A, a firm provides full credit support to some notes while\nsimultaneously holding as exposure B a portion of those notes, its full credit support\nobligation precludes any loss from its exposure from its holding of the notes. If the\nfirm can satisfactorily show that fulfilling its obligations with respect to exposure A\nwill preclude a loss from its exposure B under any circumstance, there are overlapping\nexposures between the 2 exposures and the firm need not calculate risk-weighted\nassets for exposure B.\n(3) If a banking business firm has 2 or more overlapping exposures to a\nsecuritisation, the firm must, to the extent that the exposures overlap,\ninclude in its calculation of risk-weighted assets only the exposure, or\nportion of the exposure, producing the higher or highest risk-weighted\nassets amount.\n(4) If the overlapping exposures are subject to different credit conversion\nfactors, the firm must apply the higher or highest factor to the exposures.\n4.6.27 Treatment of off-balance-sheet retained securitisation\nexposures\nA 100% credit conversion factor must be applied to an off-balance-sheet\nretained securitisation exposure unless the exposure qualifies as:\n(a) an eligible liquidity facility, or\n(b) an eligible servicer cash advance facility.\nNote 1 For risk-weighting of eligible liquidity facilities, see rules 4.6.29 and 4.6.30.\nFor risk-weighting of eligible servicer cash advance facility, see rule 4.6.31.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 175\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 4.6.28\n4.6.28 Liquidity facility and eligible liquidity facility\n(1) A liquidity facility, for a securitisation, is a commitment from the\nfacility provider to provide liquid funds if:\n(a) funds are needed to meet contractual payments to investors; and\n(b) there is a delay between the date of collection of the related cash\nflows and the date on which the payment to the investors is due.\nExample\nTiming mismatches between cash collections from the underlying assets and the\nscheduled payments to the investors in certain securitisation structures may require\nliquidity facilities to be built into the structures.\n(2) To be an eligible liquidity facility:\n(a) the commitment to provide liquid funds must be in writing and\nmust clearly state the circumstances under which the facility may\nbe availed of and the limits for any drawdown;\n(b) drawdowns must be limited to the amount that is likely to be repaid\nfully from the liquidation of the underlying exposures and any\nseller-provided credit enhancements;\n(c) the facility must not cover any losses incurred in the underlying\npool of exposures before a drawdown;\n(d) the facility must not be structured in such a way that drawdowns\nare certain;\n(e) the facility must be subject to an asset quality test that precludes it\nfrom being availed of to cover credit risk exposures that are past\ndue for more than 90 days;\n(f) if the exposures that the facility is required to fund are ECRA-rated\nsecurities, the facility can only be used to fund securities that are\nrated, by an ECRA, investment grade at the time of funding;\n(g) the facility cannot be availed of after all applicable credit\nenhancements (whether transaction-specific or programme-wide\nenhancements), from which the liquidity would benefit, have been\nexhausted; and\n(h) the repayment of drawdowns on the facility (that is, assets acquired\nunder a purchase agreement or loans made under a lending\nagreement):\n(i) must not be subordinated to any interests of any note holder\nin the programme (such as an ABCP programme); and\n(ii) must not be subject to deferral or waiver.\npage 176 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.29\n4.6.29 Treatment of certain liquidity facilities\n(1) This rule applies in relation to a liquidity facility that is not an eligible\nservicer cash advance facility.\n(2) If a banking business firm that is an originator or sponsor of a\nsecuritisation also provides such a liquidity facility to the securitisation,\nthe risk-weight of the exposure from the facility must be calculated by:\n(a) applying:\n(i) a 50% credit conversion factor (regardless of the maturity of\nthe facility) if the facility is an eligible liquidity facility; or\n(ii) a 100% credit conversion factor if the facility is not an\neligible liquidity facility; and\n(b) multiplying the resulting credit equivalent amount by the\napplicable risk-weight in table 4.6.22, depending on the credit\nrating of the firm (or by 100% if the firm is unrated).\nHowever, if an ECRA rating of the facility is itself used for risk-\nweighting the facility, a 100% credit conversion factor must be applied.\n4.6.30 Treatment of unrated eligible liquidity facility\nA banking business firm providing an eligible liquidity facility that is\nunrated, or that is treated as unrated, must apply to the resulting\nsecuritisation exposure the highest risk weight that would be applied to\nan underlying exposure covered by the facility.\nExamples when facility must be treated as unrated\n• when the facility’s rating is not publicly available (see rule 4.6.12)\n• when the facility is provided to a particular securitisation exposure (such as a\nparticular tranche) and the resulting mitigation is reflected in the ECRA rating of\nthe securitisation (see rule 4.6.35 (5))\n4.6.31 Treatment of eligible servicer cash advance facility\n(1) A servicer cash advance facility is a liquidity facility under which a\nservicer to a securitisation advances cash to ensure timely payment to\ninvestors.\nNote For servicer, see note 1 (g) under rule 4.6.5.\n(2) A zero percent risk-weight may be applied to an undrawn servicer cash\nadvance facility only if the facility is an eligible servicer cash advance\nfacility.\nNote If the servicer cash advance facility is not an eligible servicer cash advance\nfacility, see rule 4.6.29.\n(3) To be an eligible servicer cash advance facility:\n(a) the servicer must be entitled to full reimbursement;\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 177\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 4.6.32\n(b) the servicer’s right to reimbursement must be senior to other\nclaims on cash flows from the underlying pool;\n(c) the facility is itself an eligible liquidity facility; and\n(d) the facility may be cancelled at any time, without any condition\nand without any need to give advance notice.\n4.6.32 Capital relief from CRM techniques obtained by firm\n(1) A banking business firm that has obtained a CRM technique (such as\neligible collateral, an eligible credit derivative, a guarantee or an eligible\nnetting agreement) applicable to a securitisation exposure may reduce\nits capital requirement for the exposure.\n(2) Collateral pledged by an SPE as part of the securitisation may be used\nas a CRM technique if it is eligible collateral. However, an SPE of a\nsecuritisation cannot be an eligible protection provider in the\nsecuritisation.\nNote For eligible collateral, see rule 4.5.12. For eligible protection provider, see\nrule 4.6.35 (2).\n(3) In this rule, collateral is used to hedge the credit risk of a securitisation\nexposure rather than to mitigate the underlying exposures of the\nsecuritisation.\n4.6.33 Treatment of CRM techniques provided by firm\n(1) If a banking business firm provides a CRM technique to a securitisation\nexposure, the calculation of its risk-weighted assets for credit risk must\nbe in accordance with Part 4.5. The firm must calculate the capital\nrequirement as if it were an investor in the securitisation.\n(2) If a banking business firm provides a CRM technique to an unrated\ncredit enhancement, it must treat the protection provided as if it were\ndirectly holding the unrated credit enhancement.\n4.6.34 Treatment of enhanced portions\nThe capital requirement for a credit-enhanced portion of a securitisation\nmust be calculated in accordance with the standardised approach in\nPart 4.4.\n4.6.35 Effect of CRM techniques\n(1) If a CRM technique is provided to specific underlying exposures or the\nentire pool of exposures by an eligible protection provider and the credit\nrisk mitigation is reflected in the ECRA rating assigned to a\nsecuritisation exposure, the risk-weight based on that rating must be\npage 178 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.35\nused. To avoid double-counting, no additional capital recognition is\npermitted.\n(2) Eligible protection provider means:\n(a) a central counterparty;\n(b) the State of Qatar or any other sovereign;\n(c) an entity that is treated as a sovereign in accordance with the Basel\nAccords;\n(d) a public sector enterprise or other entity that has:\n(i) a risk-weight of 20% or lower; and\n(ii) a lower risk-weight than the party to whom the protection is\nprovided; or\n(e) a parent entity, subsidiary or affiliate of a party to whom the\nprotection is provided that has a lower risk-weight than the party.\n(3) If the provider of the CRM technique is not an eligible protection\nprovider, a banking business firm must treat the exposure as unrated.\n(4) A banking business firm must not use an ECRA rating if the assessment\nby the ECRA is based partly on unfunded support provided by the firm\nitself.\nExample\nIf a banking business firm buys ABCP for which it provides an unfunded securitisation\nexposure (such as a liquidity facility or credit enhancement) to the ABCP programme\nand the exposure plays a role in determining the credit assessment on the ABCP, the\nfirm must treat the ABCP as if it were unrated.\n(5) If the CRM technique is provided solely to protect a particular\nsecuritisation exposure (for example, if the technique is provided to a\ntranche of the securitisation) and the protection is reflected in the ECRA\nrating of the securitisation, a banking business firm must treat the\nexposure as unrated.\nNote For the treatment of an exposure arising from a liquidity facility of the kind\ndescribed in rule 4.6.35 (5), see rule 4.6.30.\n(6) Subrule (5) applies to a securitisation exposure whether it is in the firm’s\ntrading book or banking book. The capital requirement for a\nsecuritisation exposure in the trading book must not be less than the\namount that would be required if the exposure were in the firm’s\nbanking book.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 179\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 4.6.36\nDivision 4.6.G Early amortisation provisions\nSubdivision 4.6.G.1 General\n4.6.36 Definitions for Division 4.6.G\nIn this Division:\nexcess spread, in relation to a securitisation, means finance charge\ncollections and other income received by the SPV or trust, minus\ncertificate interest, servicing fees, charge-offs, costs and expenses.\nExcess spread is also known as future margin income.\nsecuritisation involving revolving exposures means a securitisation in\nwhich 1 or more of the underlying exposures represents, directly or\nindirectly, current or future draws on a revolving credit facility (such as\na credit card facility, home equity line of credit or commercial line of\ncredit).\nuncommitted credit line is a credit line that may be cancelled at any\ntime, without any condition and without any need to give advance\nnotice.

In such a transaction, if either party defaults at a time\nwhen the transaction has a positive economic value to the other party, a\nloss to the other party results.\n(3) The exposure to credit risk through a loan is one-sided — only the\nlender faces the risk of loss. For the kinds of transaction that create\ncounterparty credit risk, the market value of a transaction varies over\ntime with the movement of underlying market factors, and at a particular\ntime can be positive or negative to either party.\n(4) Therefore, both parties to such a transaction face a risk of loss.\nExamples\n1 A bank makes a loan to a borrower and receives collateral from the borrower.\n• The borrower is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults and does not\nreturn the collateral. Even in cases where the customer has the legal right\nto offset the amount it owes on the loan in compensation for the lost\ncollateral, the customer is still exposed to the risk of loss at the outset of\nthe loan because the value of the loan may be less than the value of the\ncollateral the time of default of the bank.\n2 A bank borrows cash from a counterparty and posts collateral to the counterparty\n(or undertakes a transaction that is economically equivalent, such as the sale and\nrepurchase (repo) of a security).\n• The bank is exposed to the risk that its counterparty defaults and does not\nreturn the collateral that the bank posted.\n• The counterparty is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults and the\namount the counterparty raises from the sale of the collateral that the bank\nposted is insufficient to cover the loss on the counterparty’s loan to the\nbank.\n3 A bank borrows a security from a counterparty and posts cash to the counterparty\nas collateral (or undertakes a transaction that is economically equivalent, such as\na reverse repo).\n• The bank is exposed to the risk that its counterparty defaults and does not\nreturn the cash that the bank posted as collateral.\n• The counterparty is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults and the cash\nthat the bank posted as collateral is insufficient to cover the loss of the\nsecurity that the bank borrowed.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 187\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6A Counterparty credit risk\nRule 4.6A.2\n4 A bank enters a derivatives transaction with a counterparty (for example, it enters\na swap transaction or purchases an option). The value of the transaction may vary\nover time with the movement of underlying market factors.\n• The bank is exposed to the risk that the counterparty defaults when the\nderivative has a positive value for the bank.\n• The counterparty is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults when the\nderivative has a positive value for the counterparty.\n4.6A.2 Transactions that Part 4.6A applies to\n(1) This Part applies to transactions of the following kinds, whether in the\nbanking book or the trading book, and whether or not settled in cash:\n(a) OTC transactions in derivatives;\n(b) exchange-traded derivatives;\n(c) long settlement transactions;\n(d) securities financing transactions.\nGuidance\n1 The transactions referred to in subrule (1) generally have the following\ncharacteristics:\n• they generate a current exposure or market value\n• their future market value is uncertain or unknown, but is affected by market\nvariables\n• they generate an exchange of future payments, or an exchange of a\nfinancial instrument (or commodities) against payment\n• the transaction has an associated random future market value based on\nmarket variables\n• they are with an identified counterparty for which a unique probability of\ndefault can be determined.\n2 Those transactions often have the following characteristics also:\n• collateral may be used to mitigate the risk exposure and is inherent in some\ntransactions\n• short-term financing may be a main purpose, in that the transactions mostly\nconsist of an exchange of one asset (cash or securities) for another for a\nrelatively short period, usually for the business purpose of financing; the\ntwo sides of the transactions are not the result of separate decisions but\nform an indivisible whole for a particular purpose\n• netting may be used to mitigate the risk\n• positions are frequently valued (most commonly daily), according to\nmarket variables\n• remargining may be employed.\nNote Long settlement transaction and securities financing transaction are\ndefined in the glossary. Securities financing transactions are usually called\nSFTs.\npage 188 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCounterparty credit risk Part 4.6A\nRule 4.6A.3\n(2) A banking business firm must calculate counterparty credit risk charges\nfor:\n(a) all bilateral transactions (see Division 4.6A.B);\n(b) all centrally cleared transactions (see Division 4.6A.C); and\n(c) default fund contributions to QCCPs, if any (see Division 4.6A.D).\n4.6A.3 Capital requirements for counterparty credit risk\n(1) A banking business firm that engages in certain classes of transactions\nthat expose it to counterparty credit risk must hold sufficient regulatory\ncapital to cover the counterparty credit risk that arises from those\ntransactions.\n(2) A banking business firm’s capital requirement for counterparty credit\nrisk is made up of the following:\n(a) the firm’s risk-weighted assets for counterparty credit risk, which\nis the sum of the following:\n(i) the firm’s risk-weighted assets representing credit exposures\nfor counterparty credit default risk (“default risk RWA”);\n(ii) the firm’s risk-weighted assets representing credit exposures\nfor counterparty credit default risk arising from trade\nexposures to a CCP (“trade exposure RWA”); and\n(iii) the firm’s risk-weighted assets representing credit exposure\narising from a default fund contribution to a non-qualifying\nCCP (“default fund RWA”);\n(b) any applicable credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk capital\ncharge;\n(c) any applicable default fund capital charge for any default fund\ncontributions to a QCCP.\nNote The amount of the firm’s total risk-weighted assets for counterparty credit\nrisk is part of the amount of its total risk-weighted assets for credit risk (see\nrule 4.1.4). The firm’s total risk-weighted assets for credit risk is its credit\nrisk capital requirement, which is part of its risk-based capital requirement\n(see rule 3.2.5).\n4.6A.4 Policies — foreign exchange rollovers\n(1) A banking business firm must have policies for entering into and\nmonitoring rollovers on foreign exchange transactions. The policies\nmust restrict the firm’s capacity to enter into such rollovers, and must\nhave been approved by the Regulatory Authority.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 189\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6A Counterparty credit risk\nRule 4.6A.5\n(2) The firm must notify the Authority if it enters into a rollover outside the\napproved policy. The Authority may direct how the rollover is to be\ntreated for capital adequacy purposes.\n(3) The firm must not enter into a transaction at an off-market price, unless\nthe transaction is a historical rate rollover on a foreign exchange\ntransaction.\n(4) A historical rate rollover on a foreign exchange transaction may be\nentered into at an off-market price (instead of current market price).\n4.6A.5 Methods for calculating counterparty credit risk exposures\n(1) Division 4.6A.B sets out the modified current exposure method (or\nmodified CEM) for calculating a banking business firm’s default risk\nRWA. Subject to subrule (2), a banking business firm must use that\nmethod.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority may direct a banking business firm to use the\nSA-CCR, or approve such a firm’s use of that method, to calculate its\ncounterparty credit risk capital requirement (or any part of that\nrequirement).\nGuidance\nThe Authority might direct an authorised firm to use the SA-CCR if:\n• at the end date of each of the 4 consecutive financial reporting periods (both\ninterim and annual) immediately preceding the date on which the calculation of\nthe CCR exposure is performed, the total notional amount of the firm’s\noutstanding derivative contracts (regardless of whether the contracts are recorded\nas assets or liabilities) does not exceed 10% of the aggregate of its total assets\nand total liabilities reported in its financial statements\n• the Authority considers that the use by the firm of the modified current exposure\nmethod would not adequately assess and reflect the firm’s CCR exposure, taking\ninto account the nature of the firm’s business.\n(3) If the Authority grants an approval or gives a direction under this rule,\nthe Authority may specify parameters or formulas to be used, or\nassumptions to be made, in applying the SA-CCR.\n(4) In this rule:\nSA-CCR means the method of calculating counterparty credit risk\nexposure set out in the document CRE52: Standardised approach to\ncounterparty credit risk, as issued by the BCBS and in force from time\nto time.\npage 190 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCounterparty credit risk Part 4.6A\nRule 4.6A.6\nDivision 4.6A.B Modified current exposure method\n4.6A.6 Transactions that Division 4.6A.B applies to\n(1) This Division applies to OTC derivative transactions, SFTs and long\nsettlement transactions that are not centrally cleared.

To determine default risk RWA for SFTs, the firm:\n(a) must calculate the counterparty credit risk exposure amount as the\nsum of:\n(i) the exposure amount for each SFT that is not covered by an\neligible netting agreement; and\n(ii) the exposure amount for all SFTs covered by an eligible\nnetting agreement;\nin accordance with Part 4.5; and\nNote 1 Eligible netting agreement is defined in the glossary.\nNote 2 In relation to how eligible netting agreements are to be applied for the\npurposes of this Division, see Subdivision 4.5.E.1.\n(b) must apply the appropriate risk weight in accordance with Division\n4.4.B.\n(3) Bilateral SFTs are not subject to a CVA risk capital charge unless the\nRegulatory Authority determines that the relevant banking business\nfirm’s CVA loss exposure arising from SFTs is material, and directs the\nfirm to apply a CVA risk capital charge:\n(a) of a specified amount; or\n(b) calculated in a specified way.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 191\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6A Counterparty credit risk\nRule 4.6A.8\n4.6A.8 Default risk RWA for OTC derivative transactions\n(1) To determine the default risk RWA for OTC derivative transactions, a\nbanking business firm must calculate a counterparty credit risk exposure\namount, and must apply to it the relevant risk weight, determined as set\nout in Division 4.4.B.\n(2) The counterparty credit risk exposure amount is the credit equivalent\namount (CEA) for all OTC derivative transactions with a particular\ncounterparty, calculated by adding together:\n(a) for each transaction not covered by an eligible bilateral netting\nagreement — the transaction-level CEA calculated as set out in\nsubrule 4.6A.9 (2); and\nNote In relation to how eligible netting agreements may be applied for the\npurposes of this Division, see Subdivision 4.5.E.1.\n(b) for transactions that are covered by an eligible bilateral netting\nagreement — the CEA calculated by the method set out in subrule\n4.6A.9 (3);\nand adjusting the sum for eligible collateral (within the extended\nmeaning given by rule 4.5.16).\n4.6A.9 Calculating credit equivalent amount\n(1) If a transaction is secured by eligible collateral or is covered by an\neligible guarantee, eligible credit derivative or eligible netting\nagreement, a CRM technique (see Part 4.5) may be used to reduce the\namount of the firm’s exposure.\n(2) CEA for transactions that are not covered by an eligible bilateral netting\nagreement is calculated as follows:\n(a) for margined transactions — by the formula:\n𝐶𝐸𝐴 = 𝐶𝐶𝐸 +𝑃𝐹𝐸\n(b) for unmargined transactions — by the formula:\n𝐶𝐸𝐴 = 𝐶𝐶𝐸 +(3×𝑃𝐹𝐸)\nwhere:\nCCE is the current credit exposure, calculated as the sum of the positive\nmark-to-market value (or replacement cost) of the transactions.\nPFE is the potential future credit exposure of the transactions,\ndetermined in accordance with rules 4.6A.10 and 4.6A.12.\npage 192 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCounterparty credit risk Part 4.6A\nRule 4.6A.13\n(3) CEA for OTC derivative transactions that are covered by an eligible\nbilateral netting agreement is calculated as follows:\n(a) for a netting agreement covering only margined transactions — by\nthe formula:\n𝐶𝐸𝐴 = 𝑁𝐶𝐶𝐸 +𝑃𝐹𝐸\n𝑎𝑑𝑗\n(b) for a netting agreement covering only unmargined transactions —\nby the formula:\n𝐶𝐸𝐴 = 𝑁𝐶𝐶𝐸 +[3×(𝑃𝐹𝐸 )]\n𝑎𝑑𝑗\n(c) for a netting agreement covering both margined and unmargined\ntransactions — by either the formula in paragraph (b) or the\nformula:\n𝐶𝐸𝐴 = 𝑁𝐶𝐶𝐸 +[(1+2×𝐴)×(𝑃𝐹𝐸 )]\n𝑎𝑑𝑗\nwhere:\nNCCE has the meaning given by subrule (4).\nA is:\n𝑃𝐹𝐸𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡\n.\n𝑃𝐹𝐸𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡\nPFE is the add-on for PFE based on the notional principal of all the\nadj\nindividual underlying contracts (that is, the gross PFE (PFE )\ngross\nadjusted to reflect the effects of the netting agreement).\nNote For how to calculate PFE , see rules 4.6A.13 and 4.6A.14.

In the case of interest rate contracts with those features and a\nremaining maturity of more than 1 year, the CCF is subject to a\nminimum of 0.5% even if there are reset dates of a shorter maturity.\nGuidance\nFor example, a principal resetting cross-currency swap or a settled-to-market\nderivative where, at the next reset date, the outstanding exposure is settled and the\nterms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero. A derivative contract with\na mandatory break (where there is a legal contractual obligation on both parties to\nterminate the transaction by the mandatory break date) would also be eligible where\nthe outstanding exposure is settled completely.\n(5) For a contract with 2 or more exchanges of principal, the CCF must be\nmultiplied by the number of exchanges of principal still to be made.\n4.6A.11 CCFs for items with terms subject to reset\n(1) For an item that is structured to settle outstanding exposures after\nspecified payment dates on which the terms are reset (that is, the marked\nto market value of the item becomes zero on the specified dates), the\nperiod to the next reset date must be taken to be the item’s residual\nmaturity.\n(2) For an interest rate item of that kind that is taken to have a residual\nmaturity of more than 1 year, the CCF to be applied must not be less\nthan 0.5% even if there are reset dates of a shorter maturity.\n(3) For an item with 2 or more exchanges of principal, the CCF must be\nmultiplied by the number of remaining exchanges under the item.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 195\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6A Counterparty credit risk\nRule 4.6A.12\n4.6A.12 Calculating PFE — transactions covered by eligible\nadj\nbilateral netting agreements\n(1) A banking business firm must recognise the effects of an eligible\nbilateral netting agreement on its potential future credit exposure by\napplying the following formula to produce an adjusted add-on amount\nfor PFE on all contracts subject to the netting agreement:\n𝑃𝐹𝐸 = 0.4 (𝑃𝐹𝐸 )+0.6 (𝑁𝐺𝑅 ×𝑃𝐹𝐸 )\n𝑎𝑑𝑗 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠\nNote In relation to how eligible netting agreements may be applied for the\npurposes of this Division, see Subdivision 4.5.E.1.\n(2) PFE is the sum of the firm’s potential future credit exposures for\ngross\neach transaction covered by a netting agreement (except transactions\ncovered by the definition of NCCE in subrule 4.6A.9 (4)) as if no netting\nwould occur. PFE for each transaction is calculated by multiplying the\nnotional principal amount of the transaction by the appropriate CCF for\nthat transaction set out in table 4.6A.14.\n(3) To calculate PFE , a banking business firm may treat matching\ngross\ntransactions included in a netting agreement as a single transaction with\na notional principal equal to the net receipts on the transactions.\nGuidance\nFor that purpose, matching transactions are forward foreign exchange transactions and\nother similar market-related transactions in which the notional principal is equivalent\nto a cash flow, if the cash flows fall due on the same value date and are in the same\ncurrency.\n4.6A.13 Calculating PFE — transactions covered by eligible\nadj\nbilateral netting agreements — net to gross ratio\n(1) The net to gross ratio (NGR) is the ratio of the net current exposure of\nall the transactions covered by an eligible bilateral netting agreement to\nthe gross current credit exposure (GCCE) of those transactions.

and\n(b) the risk management requirements in rule 4.6A.40.\n(5) For transactions cleared through a CCP that is not a QCCP, a banking\nbusiness firm must apply:\n(a) the counterparty credit risk capital requirements for exposures to a\nnon-qualifying CCP in rule 4.6A.37; and\n(b) the risk management requirements in rule 4.6A.40.\n(6) If a CCP ceases to qualify as a QCCP, then, for the purposes of this\nSubdivision, a banking business firm may continue, for 3 months\nafterwards, to treat transactions with the CCP as though the CCP were\nstill a QCCP (subject to any direction by the Regulatory Authority).\nAfter that period, the firm must treat exposures to the CCP according to\nrule 4.6A.37.\n4.6A.20 Key concept — qualifying CCP\n(1) A qualifying central counterparty (or qualifying CCP or QCCP) is an\nentity for which all of the following are true:\n(a) it is authorised or licensed to operate as a CCP (including a licence\ngranted by way of confirming an exemption);\n(b) it is permitted by a financial regulator to operate as a CCP with\nrespect to the products offered;\n(c) it satisfies either subrule (2) or subrule (3);\n(d) it publishes sufficient information about the factors necessary to\ncalculate its regulatory capital:\n(i) to allow each of its clearing members to calculate the\nmember’s capital requirement for the member’s\ncontributions to the CCP’s default fund; and\n(ii) for the regulatory authority that supervises such a member to\nreview and confirm that calculation.\n(2) A CCP satisfies this subrule if it is based and prudentially supervised in\na jurisdiction in which the relevant regulatory authority:\n(a) has established rules and regulations that are consistent with the\nPrinciples for Financial Market Infrastructures issued jointly,\npage 200 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCounterparty credit risk Part 4.6A\nRule 4.6A.21\nunder that title, by the Committee on Payments and Market\nInfrastructures of the BCBS and the International Organization of\nSecurities Commissions;

and\n(b) a transaction is considered to be unmargined if no variation\nmargin is exchanged;\nwhether or not there is collateral other than variation margin.\n4.6A.22 Key concept — trade exposure\n(1) A trade exposure is an exposure that a clearing member, or a client of\na clearing member, has to a CCP, reflecting a measure of the current\nmark-to-market value (replacement cost) and the potential future\nexposure arising from transactions to which this Division applies (see\nrule 4.6A.5 (1)).\n(2) Trade exposure is calculated on a bilateral basis, and must include the\ninitial margin posted by a banking business firm, and any variation\nmargin due to the firm from the CCP that has not yet been received.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 201\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6A Counterparty credit risk\nRule 4.6A.23\n4.6A.23 Other definitions for Division 4.6A.C\n(1) In this Division:\nclearing member of a CCP means a member of, or a direct participant\nin, a CCP that is entitled to enter into transactions with the CCP.\nclearing member firm means a banking business firm that is a clearing\nmember of a CCP.\nclient of a clearing member firm means a party to a transaction with a\nCCP through the firm, where the firm either:\n(a) acts as a financial intermediary; or\n(b) guarantees the client’s performance to the CCP.\n(2) A banking business firm is a client firm if:\n(a) the firm clears through a QCCP indirectly as a client of a clearing\nmember that acts as a financial intermediary (that is, the clearing\nmember completes an offsetting transaction with the QCCP); or\n(b) the firm enters into a transaction with a QCCP, and a clearing\nmember firm guarantees the firm’s performance.\n(3) In this Division, a reference to collateral posted by a banking business\nfirm to a QCCP includes:\n(a) initial margin;\n(b) any variation margin due to the firm from the QCCP but not yet\nreceived;\n(c) cash, securities, and other pledged assets; and\n(d) any excess initial or variation margin;\nbut does not include any default fund contribution.\n4.6A.24 Transactions settled to market\n(1) A banking business firm may treat a transaction as settled-to-market,\nand as being an unmargined transaction with remaining maturity (M)\ni\nequal to the time until the next exchange of variation margin, if:\n(a) the outstanding exposure is settled by variation margin and the\nterms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero; and\n(b) the firm has a legal opinion to support that treatment.\nGuidance\nA centrally cleared derivative transaction is said to have been settled-to-market if the\nvariation margin paid constitutes settlement of the exposure, as opposed to the posting\nof collateral.\n(2) However, the remaining maturity of an unmargined transaction is\nsubject to a minimum of 10 business days.\npage 202 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCounterparty credit risk Part 4.6A\nRule 4.6A.25\n4.6A.25 Centrally cleared transactions under bilateral agreements\nFor an exchange-traded derivative where the transaction between the\nclearing member and client is conducted under a bilateral agreement, a\nbanking business firm that is either a clearing member firm or a client\nfirm must treat the transaction as an OTC derivative transaction for the\npurposes of this Part.\n4.6A.26 Exposures from transactions cleared through QCCP\n(1) For transactions cleared through a QCCP, a clearing member firm must\ncalculate each of the following counterparty credit risk requirements:\n(a) trade exposure RWA on the firm’s trade exposure to the QCCP\naccording to rules 4.6A.27 to 4.6A.32;\n(b) a default fund capital charge on the default fund contribution to the\nQCCP, according to Division 4.6A.D;\n(c) if the firm has provided a guarantee of a client transaction to the\nQCCP or acts as a financial intermediary between a client and the\nQCCP (that is, the firm completes an offsetting transaction with\nthe QCCP) — default risk RWA and a CVA risk capital charge on\nthe counterparty credit risk exposure to its client, according to rule\n4.6A.41;\n(d) if the firm has provided a guarantee to a client by undertaking an\nobligation to reimburse the client for any losses suffered due to\nchanges in transaction value if a QCCP defaults — trade exposure\nRWA and a default fund capital charge on the guaranteed\ntransaction.\n(2) A banking business firm that is acting as a client of a clearing member\nto a QCCP must apply the counterparty credit risk requirements set out\nin rule 4.6A.34.\n4.6A.27 Trade exposure RWA for clearing member firm’s exposure\nto QCCP\n(1) To calculate trade exposure RWA, a clearing member firm must\ncalculate its trade exposure to the QCCP, and must apply the relevant\nrisk weights, according to rules 4.6A.28 to 4.6A.32.\n(2) For the clearing member firm-to-QCCP leg of a transaction cleared\nthrough a QCCP, a clearing member firm must calculate its trade\nexposure to the QCCP:\n(a) for derivative transactions — by the modified CEM set out in\nDivision 4.6A.B;

Also, the\naccounting treatment of an exposure does not determine its\nclassification under this Part.\n4.7.14 Effect of collateral\n(1) When classifying an exposure, a banking business firm must not treat\ncollateral or other risk-mitigation arrangements as affecting the\nclassification of the exposure.\n(2) However, the firm may take collateral into account in assessing the\nborrower’s economic incentive to pay.\n(3) The firm must not treat the collateralisation of an exposure as affecting\nthe exposure’s past-due status or the counting of past-due days.\n(4) The firm must classify an exposure as non-performing for this Part if\nthe exposure satisfies the conditions for being so classified in\nrule 4.7.10 (4), even if the value of collateral held is more than the\namount of the past-due exposure.\n4.7.15 Level of application\n(1) If a banking business firm has more than 1 exposure to a particular non-\nretail counterparty, the firm must consider all of its exposures to that\ncounterparty as non-performing if a material exposure to the\ncounterparty is non-performing. That is, non-performing status is\napplied to the counterparty.\n(2) In the case of a banking business firm’s exposure to a retail\ncounterparty, non-performing status is applied to the transaction.\nHowever, if the firm has more than 1 exposure to a particular retail\ncounterparty, the firm must, when deciding about the status of 1 such\nexposure, consider the status of the other exposures.\nGuidance\nQFC banking business firms are not permitted to undertake retail banking.\n(3) If a banking business firm has exposures to 2 or more members of a\ncorporate group, the firm may apply non-performing status to each\nmember.

The\nfollowing list of indications that a counterparty is in financial difficulty is not intended\nto be exhaustive:\n• the counterparty is currently past due on a material exposure\n• no exposure to the counterparty is currently past due, but a material one is likely\nto be past due in future (for instance, there has been a pattern of delinquency in\npayments on its material exposures) unless a concession is made\n• the counterparty’s outstanding securities have been delisted, are in the process of\nbeing delisted, or are under threat of being delisted, from an exchange for non-\ncompliance with the listing requirements or for financial reasons\n• on the basis of the counterparty’s actual performance, and estimates and\nprojections that take into account the counterparty’s current capabilities, the firm\nexpects that, for the foreseeable future, the counterparty’s available cash flows\nwill be insufficient to service all its loans or debt securities (both interest and\nprincipal) in accordance with the terms of the existing agreements\n• the counterparty has already shown that it has difficulty in repaying in accordance\nwith the credit categorisation scheme within the firm’s internal credit rating\nsystem\n• a material exposure to the counterparty is classified as non-performing or would\nbe so classified without the concessions\n• the counterparty cannot obtain funds from other sources at an effective interest\nrate equal to the current market interest rate for similar loans or debt securities\nfor a non-troubled counterparty.\n(4) Refinancing an existing exposure with a new contract because of the\ncounterparty’s financial difficulty is a concession, even if the terms of\nthe new contract are no more favourable to the counterparty than those\nof the existing one.\n(5) The main characteristic of a concession is that the firm would not extend\nloans or grant commitments to the counterparty, or purchase its debt\nsecurities, on such terms and conditions under normal market\nconditions.\n(6) A concession might, but need not, result in a loss for the firm. A\nconcession could be any of the following:\n(a) a modification of the terms and conditions of the exposure;\n(b) a total or partial refinance of the exposure;\n(c) changes in the conditions of the existing exposure, giving more\nfavourable terms for the counterparty;\n(d) a supplementary agreement;\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 225\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule 4.7.18\n(e) the exercise of contractual rights that enable the counterparty to\nchange the terms and conditions of the contract or to take on\nadditional loans, debt securities or off-balance-sheet items at its\nown discretion.\nExamples of concessions\n• extending the loan term\n• rescheduling the dates of principal or interest payments\n• granting new or additional periods of non-payment (grace period)\n• reducing the interest rate, resulting in an effective interest rate below the rate that\ncounterparties with similar risk characteristics could obtain in the market\n• capitalising arrears\n• forgiving, deferring or postponing principal, interest or fees\n• changing an amortising loan to an interest payment only\n• releasing collateral or accepting lower levels of collateralisation\n• allowing the conversion of debt to equity of the counterparty\n• deferring recovery or collection action for extended periods\n• easing of covenants\n• refinancing an existing exposure with a new contract, even if the terms of the new\ncontract are no more favourable for the counterparty than those of the existing\nexposure.\n4.7.18 Meaning of forborne exposure and forbearance for Part 4.7\n(1) For this Part, an exposure of a banking business firm is a forborne\nexposure if the firm has granted a concession (see rule 4.7.17) to the\ncounterparty.\nNote There is no concession to a counterparty (and therefore no forbearance)\nunless the counterparty is experiencing, or is likely to experience, financial\ndifficulty — see rule 4.7.17 (2).\n(2) In the circumstances described in subrule (1), the firm has granted\nforbearance to the counterparty, and has applied forbearance to the\nexposure.\n4.7.19 Relationship between performance and forbearance\n(1) A banking business firm may apply forbearance to either a performing\nor a non-performing exposure.\n(2) If a banking business firm applies forbearance to a non-performing\nexposure, the firm must continue to classify the exposure as non-\nperforming.\n4.7.20 Application of forbearance to performing exposures\n(1) This rule applies if a banking business firm applies forbearance to a\nperforming exposure.\npage 226 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nProblem assets and provisioning Part 4.7\nRule 4.7.21\n(2) The firm must decide whether the exposure meets the definition of a\nnon-performing exposure, even if the forbearance results in a new\nexposure.\n(3) If the firm decides that the original exposure would have been treated\nas non-performing when the firm applied the forbearance, the new\nexposure must be treated as non-performing.\n4.7.21 Criteria for exit from forbearance\n(1) An exposure to which forbearance has been applied continues to be a\nforborne exposure until:\n(a) all payments, according to the new contractual terms, have been\nmade in a timely manner over a continuous period of at least\n1 year; and\n(b) the counterparty has resolved its financial difficulty.\n(2) The period mentioned in subrule (1) (a) starts at the scheduled start of\npayments under the new contractual terms, regardless of whether the\nexposure was classified as performing or non-performing when the\nforbearance was granted.\n(3) If another forbearance is applied to a forborne exposure before its\nrelease from the first forbearance, that period starts again with the new\nforbearance.\n(4) Nothing prevents the period mentioned in subrule (1) (a) for an\nexposure from running concurrently with a period mentioned in\nrule 4.7.16 (1) for the same exposure.\nDivision 4.7.D Provisioning\n4.7.22 Meaning of provisioning\nProvisioning means setting aside an amount to cover expected losses,\nbased on loan-loss probability. Provisioning is made before profit is\nearned.\n4.7.23 Credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses\n(1) A banking business firm must adopt, document and adhere to sound\nmethods that address policies, processes and controls for assessing and\nmeasuring credit losses on all the firm’s exposures. The measurement\nof provisions must build on robust methods and must result in the\nappropriate and timely recognition of expected credit losses in\naccordance with the applicable accounting standard.\n(2) The firm’s aggregate amount of provisions for credit losses must be\nadequate and consistent with the applicable accounting standard.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 227\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule 4.7.24\n(3) The firm must have sound policies and processes to appropriately\nvalidate the models that it uses to assess and measure expected credit\nlosses.\n(4) The firm must use experienced credit judgement, particularly in the\nrobust consideration of reasonable and supportable forward-looking\ninformation, including macroeconomic factors, in its assessment and\nmeasurement of expected credit losses.\n(5) The firm must have an appropriate credit risk assessment and\nmeasurement process that provides it with a sound basis for common\nsystems, tools and data to assess credit risk and to account for expected\ncredit losses.\n4.7.24 Provisioning policy\nDepending on the nature, scale and complexity of a banking business\nfirm’s business, and of the credit it provides, the firm’s provisioning\npolicy must set out:\n(a) the areas of its business to which the policy applies;\n(b) whether the firm uses different approaches to those areas, and the\nsignificant differences in approach;\n(c) who is responsible for regularly monitoring its assets, to identify\nproblem or potential problem assets, and the factors it takes into\naccount in identifying them;\n(d) the extent to which the value of any collateral, guarantees or\ninsurance that the firm holds affects the need for, or the level of,\nprovisions;\n(e) the basis on which the firm makes its provisions, including the\nextent to which their levels are left to managerial judgement or to\na committee;\n(f) the methods, debt management systems or formulae used to set the\nlevels of provisions and the factors that must be considered in\ndeciding whether the provisions are adequate;\n(g) the reports to enable the firm’s governing body and senior\nmanagement to ensure that the firm maintains adequate provisions;\n(h) the procedures and responsibilities for arrears management and the\nrecovery of exposures in arrears or exposures that have had\nprovisions made against them;\n(i) the procedures for writing off and writing back provisions; and\n(j) the procedures for calculating and making provisions for\ncontingent and other liabilities (such as contingent liabilities that\npage 228 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nProblem assets and provisioning Part 4.7\nRule 4.7.25\nhave crystallised from acceptances, endorsements, guarantees,\nperformance bonds, indemnities, irrevocable letters of credit and\nthe confirmation of documentary credits).\n4.7.25 Making provision for credit losses\n(1) A banking business firm must ensure that it maintains provisions for\ncredit losses that, taken together, are prudent, reasonable and adequate\nto absorb such losses, given the relevant facts and circumstances. The\nlosses covered must include:\n(a) losses incurred;\n(b) losses incurred but not yet reported; and\n(c) losses estimated but not certain to arise;\nextending over the life of the individual credits that make up its credit\nportfolio.\n(2) The firm must also ensure that provisions and write-offs are timely and\nreflect realistic repayment and recovery expectations, taking into\naccount market and macroeconomic conditions. The firm must consider\nall the significant factors that affect the likelihood of collecting on the\ntransactions that make up its credit portfolio and the estimated future\ncredit losses on those transactions.\n(3) Provisions may be general (assessed collectively against the whole of a\nportfolio) or specific (assessed against individual credits), or both.\n(4) The firm must take into account off-balance-sheet exposures in\nprovisioning. However, no provisioning is necessary for off-balance-\nsheet exposures that the firm can unilaterally cancel.\n4.7.26 Amount of provisioning\n(1) Subject to any direction under subrule (2), a banking business firm must\nmake provision for credit losses in accordance with the applicable\naccounting standard.\n(2) If the Regulatory Authority considers that the firm’s provisioning for an\nexposure, or some or all of its exposures, is insufficient, the Authority\nmay direct the firm to apply rule 4.7.27.\n4.7.27 Prescribed provisioning\n(1) If the Regulatory Authority considers that a banking business firm’s\nown practices for identifying provisions are inadequate in view of its\ncredit risk profile, the Authority may direct the firm to implement\nprescribed provisioning in accordance with this rule.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 229\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule 4.7.27\n(2) To implement prescribed provisioning, the firm must classify exposures\nto which this Part applies (subject to subrule (7)) into the 5 categories\nin subrule (3).\n(3) The classification is as follows:\n(a) an exposure is classified as performing if:\n(i) there is no uncertainty about the timely repayment of the\noutstanding amounts; and\n(ii) it is currently in regular payment status with prompt\npayments;\n(b) an exposure is classified as special mention if any of the following\nsubparagraphs is true of it:\n(i) it is of deteriorating or potentially deteriorating credit quality\nthat may adversely affect the counterparty’s ability to make\nscheduled payments on time;\n(ii) it is 30 to 90 days in arrears;\n(iii) it shows weakness arising from the counterparty’s financial\nposition;\n(iv) it is affected by market circumstances or any other industry-\nrelated concerns;\n(c) an exposure is classified as substandard if:\n(i) it shows definite deterioration in credit quality and impaired\nrepayment ability of the counterparty; or\n(ii) it is 91 to 180 days in arrears;\n(d) an exposure is classified as doubtful if:\n(i) it shows significant credit quality deterioration, worse than\nin the substandard category, to the extent that the prospect of\nfully recovering all the outstanding amounts is questionable\nand the probability of a loss is high (though the exact amount\nof loss cannot be determined yet); or\n(ii) it is 181 to 270 days in arrears;\n(e) an exposure is classified as loss if:\n(i) it is assessed as uncollectable;\n(ii) the probability of recovering the amount due is very low; or\n(iii) it is more than 270 days in arrears.\n(4) Nothing prevents the firm from classifying an exposure in a higher\ncategory than subrule (3) requires. For this subrule, the highest category\nis loss, and the lowest is performing.\npage 230 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nProblem assets and provisioning Part 4.7\nRule 4.7.27\n(5) The firm must classify all of its exposures to a particular counterparty\nas of the same category unless there is good reason not to do so.\n(6) The firm must make provisions for credit losses that in total at least meet\nthe requirements in table 4.7.27.\nNote If the result is to increase the firm’s provision for credit losses, the amount\nof the increase must be deducted from CET 1 capital — see rule 3.2.28.\n(7) Prescribed provisioning does not apply to exposures of the following\nkinds:\n(a) forborne exposures (see Division 4.7.C) that meet the criteria to be\nclassified as performing (see rule 4.7.10);\n(b) any asset acquired through enforcing a security;\n(c) real estate that the firm owns.\nTable 4.7.27 Provisioning requirements\nCategory of minimum provisioning\nexposure requirement\n(% of unsecured part of credit)\nPerforming 0\nSpecial mention 5 (or a lesser percentage\ndirected by the Authority)\nSubstandard 20\nDoubtful 50\nLoss 100\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 231\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.8 Transactions with related parties\nRule 4.8.1\nPart 4.8 Transactions with related parties\n4.8.1 Introduction\n(1) To guard against abuses in lending to related parties and to address\nconflicts of interest, this Part requires transactions with related parties\nto be at arm’s length and subject to appropriate supervision and limits.\n(2) Related-party transactions must be interpreted broadly. Related party\ntransactions include on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet credit\nexposures, service contracts, asset purchases and sales, construction\ncontracts, lease agreements, derivative transactions, borrowing and\nwrite-offs.\n4.8.2 Concept of related parties\n(1) The concept of parties being related to a banking business firm is used\nin these rules in relation to parties over which the firm exercises control\nor parties that exercise control over the firm. The concept is primarily\nused in relation to the requirement that the firm’s transactions be at\narm’s length.\n(2) In contrast, the concept of parties being connected to one another (which\nis discussed with concentration risk in Chapter 5) is used in these rules\nto measure concentration risk and large exposures.\n(3) It is of course possible for connected counterparties to be related to the\nbanking business firm holding the exposure concerned.\nNote For purposes of concentration risk, the firm’s exposure to connected\ncounterparties (whether related or not) is taken to be a single risk.\n4.8.3 Related parties\nRelated parties, of a banking business firm, includes:\n(a) any other member of the firm’s corporate group;\n(b) any individual who is able to exercise significant influence over\nthe firm;\n(c) any affiliate of the firm; and\n(d) any entity that the Regulatory Authority directs the firm to include.\nGuidance\nRelated party is wider than a firm’s corporate group in that it includes individuals.\nRelated parties include the banking business firm’s subsidiaries and major stock\nholders; members of its governing body; its senior management and key employees.\nNote Affiliate is defined in the glossary.\npage 232 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nTransactions with related parties Part 4.8\nRule 4.8.4\n4.8.4 Role of governing body—related parties\n(1) A banking business firm’s governing body must ensure that the firm’s\npolicies relating to related-party transactions are complied with and that\nany exceptions are reported to the appropriate level of the senior\nmanagement, and, if necessary, to the governing body.\n(2) The governing body must also ensure that the firm’s senior management\nmonitors transactions with related parties, takes appropriate steps to\ncontrol or mitigate the risks from such transactions and writes off\nexposures to related parties only in accordance with the firm’s policies.\n(3) The governing body must approve transactions with related parties, and\nthe write-off of related-party exposures, if such transactions or write-off\nexceeds specified amounts or otherwise poses any special risk.\n4.8.5 Policies—transactions with related parties\n(1) A banking business firm’s policy must establish:\n(a) effective systems to identify, monitor and report individual and\ntotal exposures to, and transactions with, related parties;\n(b) procedures to prevent a member of the governing body, a member\nof the firm’s senior management or any other person who stands\nto gain a benefit from a related-party transaction from being part\nof the process of granting and managing the transaction;\n(c) well-defined criteria for the write-off of exposures to related\nparties;\n(d) prudent and appropriate limits to prevent or address conflicts of\ninterest; and\n(e) procedures for tracking and reporting exceptions to, and deviations\nfrom, limits or policies.\n4.8.6 Transactions must be arm’s length\nA transaction with a related party must not be undertaken on terms more\nfavourable to the party than a corresponding transaction with a non-\nrelated party.\nGuidance\nFavourable terms could relate to interest rate, credit assessment, tenor, fees,\namortisation schedule and need for collateral.

This Chapter also sets limits on the firm’s exposures\nto individual counterparties and connected counterparties.\n(2) Concentration risk is the potential for a loss in value of an investment\nportfolio or a financial institution when a group of exposures moves\ntogether in an unfavourable direction. Concentration risk in a banking\nbusiness firm’s portfolio arises from concentration on a single\ncounterparty, sector or country.\nGuidance\nThe implication of concentration risk is that it generates such a significant loss that\nrecovery is unlikely.\n5.1.2 Meaning of risk concentration\n(1) A risk concentration is a single exposure, or a group of exposures with\na common element, that is capable of producing a loss that is large\nenough:\n(a) to threaten a banking business firm’s viability or its ability to\nmaintain its core operations; or\n(b) to produce a material change in its risk profile.\n(2) A risk concentration can arise in a banking business firm’s assets,\nliabilities or off-balance-sheet items through the execution or processing\nof transactions (either product or service), or through a combination of\nexposures.\nGuidance\nExamples of a common element among a banking business firm’s exposures that could\ncreate a risk concentration are the following:\n• that the counterparties are connected or related\n• that the exposures are disproportionately denominated in a particular currency\n• that the counterparties are concentrated in particular geographical locations or\nparticular industry sectors\n• that the exposures are concentrated in particular products\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 235\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.1 General\nRule 5.1.3\n• reliance on particular service providers (such as a provider of back-office\nservices).\n5.1.3 Identification of risk concentrations\nA banking business firm must identify the risk concentrations in its\nportfolio, including those arising from:\n(a) large exposures to a single counterparty;\n(b) exposures to connected counterparties;\n(c) exposures to counterparties in the same industry, economic sector,\ngeographical region or country; and\n(d) exposures to counterparties whose financial performance depends\non the same activity, commodity or product.\n5.1.4 Policies — risk concentrations — sources and limits\n(1) A banking business firm must have a policy on the management of risk\nconcentrations.\n(2) The policy must set limits for acceptable risk concentrations, consistent\nwith the firm’s risk appetite, risk profile and capital. The limits must be\nmade known to, and must be understood by, all relevant staff.\n(3) The policy must ensure that:\n(a) the firm’s information systems identify exposures that create risk\nconcentrations, aggregate those exposures and facilitate their\nmanagement; and\n(b) all significant risk concentrations are reviewed regularly and\nreported to the firm’s governing body or senior management.\nGuidance\nA banking business firm’s policies should be flexible to help the firm to identify risk\nconcentrations. To achieve this, the systems should be capable of analysing the firm’s\ncredit portfolio by:\n• size of exposure\n• exposures to connected counterparties\n• product\n• geography\n• industry or sector (for example, manufacturing and industrial)\n• account performance\n• internal credit risk assessment\n• funding\n• outstandings versus commitments\n• types and coverage of collateral.\npage 236 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nGeneral Part 5.1\nRule 5.1.5\n5.1.5 Role of governing body — risk concentrations\n(1) A banking business firm’s governing body must ensure that the firm’s\npolicy for the management of risk concentrations gives a comprehensive\nfirm-wide view of the significant sources of risk concentrations\n(including exposures on and off its balance sheet and from contingent\nliabilities).\n(2) The governing body must also ensure that the firm’s senior management\nmonitors the firm’s large exposures, and that the large exposure limits\n(see rule 5.2.9) are not exceeded on a solo or consolidated basis.\n5.1.6 Relationship to stress-testing\nWhen carrying out stress-testing or reviewing stress scenarios, a\nbanking business firm must take into account significant risk\nconcentrations and large exposures, and the effects of changes in market\nconditions and risk factors on them.\n5.1.7 Regulatory Authority can set different limits and minimum\ncapital adequacy ratios\n(1) Despite anything in these rules, the Regulatory Authority may, in\nwriting, set specific limits on a banking business firm’s exposures to\nparticular counterparties, groups of counterparties, industries, sectors,\nregions, countries or asset classes on a case-by-case basis.\n(2) If a banking business firm has 1 or more large exposures (excluding\nexempted exposures) or if, in the Authority’s opinion, the firm is\nexposed to a significant level of risk concentration, the Authority may\nincrease any 1 or more of the firm’s minimum capital adequacy ratios.\n(3) In considering whether to increase any of the firm’s minimum capital\nadequacy ratios, the Authority will take into account:\n(a) whether the increased ratio would be consistent with the firm’s risk\nconcentration and large exposure policies;\n(b) the number of exposures, and the size and nature of each; and\n(c) the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s business and the\nexperience of its governing body and senior management.\n(4) The Regulatory Authority may also direct the firm to take measures to\nreduce its level of risk concentration.\nNote Under FSR, article 16, the Regulatory Authority may modify or waive the\napplication of a prudential requirement to an authorised firm or firms.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 237\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.1\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nDivision 5.2.A General\n5.2.1 What Part 5.2 does\nThis Part implements, for banking business firms in the QFC, the\nrecommendations of the BCBS about the management of large\nexposures.\n5.2.2 Definitions for Part 5.2\nIn this Part:\nexempted counterparty means a counterparty that is any of the\nfollowing:\n(a) a sovereign;\n(b) a central bank;\n(c) a PSE that is assigned a 0% risk weight under rule 4.4.14;\n(d) an MDB that qualifies for 0% risk weight.\nNote For the list of such MDBs, see rule 4.4.16.\nexempted exposure means an exposure that arises from a claim,\ncommitment or contingent liability of any of the following kinds:\n(a) a claim by, or a commitment or contingent liability to, an exempted\ncounterparty;\n(b) a claim, commitment or contingent liability the amount of which\nis deducted from the firm’s regulatory capital (see Division 3.2.D);\nGuidance\nIf the amount of such a claim, commitment or contingent liability were not\ndeducted from the firm’s regulatory capital, it would be added to the firm’s other\nexposures to the relevant counterparty. (It would be assigned a risk weight of\n1,250% for the purpose of calculating the firm’s risk-weighted assets.)\n(c) a claim, commitment or contingent liability that is secured by\neligible collateral (see rule 4.5.12) that was issued by an exempted\ncounterparty;\n(d) a claim, commitment or contingent liability that is covered by an\neligible guarantee (see rule 4.5.27) that was given by an exempted\ncounterparty;\n(e) an exposure to a QCCP that is related to clearing;\n(f) certain net short positions (see rule 5.2.31 (4)).\nexposure to a counterparty (or a group of connected counterparties)\nmeans the total of all of a banking business firm’s claims, commitments\npage 238 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.3\nand contingent liabilities arising from transactions with the counterparty\nor a member or members of the group (whether on or off the firm’s\nbalance sheet, and whether held in the firm’s banking book or its trading\nbook) but does not include an intra-day exposure to another banking\nbusiness firm or a bank.\ngroup of connected counterparties has the meaning given by rule 5.2.5.\nlarge exposure of a banking business firm means an exposure to a\ncounterparty or group of connected counterparties that is equal to 10%\nor more of the firm’s tier 1 capital.\n5.2.3 Value of claim etc for Part 5.2\nFor the purpose of calculating a banking business firm’s exposure to a\ncounterparty or group of connected counterparties, the value of a claim,\ncommitment or contingent liability must be calculated in accordance\nwith Division 5.2.D.\n5.2.4 Policies in relation to large exposures\n(1) A banking business firm must establish and implement appropriate\npolicies for the management of large exposures. In particular, the\npolicies must include:\n(a) exposure limits, commensurate with the firm’s risk appetite, risk\nprofile and capital, for exposures to:\n(i) categories of counterparties (for example, sovereigns, other\nauthorised firms and other financial entities, corporate and\nindividual borrowers);\n(ii) single counterparties and groups of connected\ncounterparties;\n(iii) particular industries or sectors;\n(iv) particular countries; and\n(v) asset classes (for example, property holdings);\n(b) the circumstances in which the exposure limits may be exceeded,\nand the processes required for approving such excesses (for\nexample, approval by the firm’s governing body); and\n(c) procedures for identifying, measuring, managing and reporting\nlarge exposures.\n(2) The policies must ensure that the firm:\n(a) has adequate systems and controls to identify, measure, monitor\nand report large exposures and risk concentrations in a timely\nmanner; and\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 239\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.5\n(b) reviews its large exposures and risk concentrations at least\nannually.\nDivision 5.2.B Connected counterparties\n5.2.5 Meaning of group of connected counterparties\nTwo or more of a banking business firm’s counterparties (other than\nexempted counterparties) form a group of connected counterparties if:\n(a) they are connected by any 1 or more of the following:\n(i) a control relationship (see rule 5.2.6);\n(ii) a relationship of economic interdependence (see rule 5.2.7);\n(iii) any other connection or relationship that, in the firm’s\nopinion, requires it to treat the counterparties as constituting\na single risk;\n(b) in the case of investments in structured vehicles — they have in\ncommon a third party (such as an originator, fund manager,\nliquidity provider or credit protection provider) that should be\ntreated as a common risk factor (see rule 5.2.23).\nGuidance\n1 The concept of parties or counterparties being connected to one another is used\nin these rules in relation to counterparties or issuers to which a banking business\nfirm has exposures. Connected counterparties are the basis for measuring risk\nconcentrations and large exposures.\n2 Nothing prevents the members of a group of connected counterparties being\nconnected in 2 or more of the ways mentioned. If counterparties that are part of\ndifferent control groups are interconnected by economic interdependency, all\nentities for which there is a “chain of contagion” need to be grouped into one\ngroup of connected counterparties. The chain of contagion leading to a possible\ndefault of all entities concerned is the relevant factor for the grouping and needs\nto be assessed in each individual case.\n3 In contrast, the concept of parties being related to a banking business firm (which\nis discussed with credit risk in Chapter 4) is primarily used in relation to the\nrequirement that the firm’s transactions be at arm’s length.\n4 It is of course possible for a firm’s related parties to be connected counterparties\n(such as when the firm has exposures to them).\n5.2.6 Connected counterparties — control relationship\n(1) A control relationship exists between 2 counterparties if either has\ncontrol of the other.\npage 240 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.7\n(2) Whether a control relationship exists between 2 counterparties is to be\ndecided in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.\nGuidance\n1 A control relationship is likely to exist between 2 counterparties if 1 of them owns\n50% or more of the voting rights in the other.\n2 To decide whether a control relationship exists between 2 counterparties, a\nbanking business firm should take at least the following factors into account:\n• the existence of voting agreements (such as control of a majority of voting\nrights by means of an agreement with other shareholders)\n• whether a member (A) is able to exercise significant influence over the\nappointment or dismissal of another member’s administrative,\nmanagement or supervisory body (for example, if A has as the right to\nappoint or remove a majority of members of such a body, or a majority of\nmembers of such a body have been appointed solely as a result of A’s\nexercise of its voting rights)\n• whether a member (A) is able to exercise significant influence over the\nsenior management of another (B) (for example, A has the power to\nexercise a controlling influence over B’s management or policies (such as\nby A’s having consent rights over significant decisions)).\n(3) However, even if control of 1 entity by another is established, the\nbanking business firm concerned need not treat the counterparties as a\ngroup of connected counterparties if it can show the Regulatory\nAuthority that, despite the control, the entities do not form a group of\nconnected counterparties (for example, because of particular\ncircumstances or corporate governance safeguards).\n5.2.7 Connected counterparties — economic interdependence\n(1) To decide whether or not 2 counterparties are connected by a\nrelationship of economic interdependence, the firm must take into\naccount at least the following matters:\n(a) whether 50% or more of 1 counterparty’s gross receipts or gross\nexpenditures (on an annual basis) is derived from transactions with\nthe other (for example, the owner of a property and a tenant that\npays a significant part of the rent);\n(b) whether 1 counterparty has fully or partly guaranteed the exposure\nof the other, or is liable by other means, and the relevant exposure\nis so significant that the guarantor would be likely to default if a\nclaim were made;\n(c) whether a significant part of 1 counterparty’s production or output\nis sold to the other, and the other could not easily be replaced by\nother customers within a reasonable period;\n(d) whether the expected source of funds to repay the loans of both\ncounterparties is the same and neither has another independent\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 241\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.8\nsource of income from which loans could be serviced and fully\nrepaid;\n(e) whether it is likely that 1 counterparty’s financial problems would\ncause difficulties for the other in terms of full and timely\nrepayment of the other’s liabilities;\n(f) whether 1 counterparty’s insolvency or default would be likely to\nbe associated with the insolvency or default of the other;\n(g) if both counterparties rely on the same provider for the majority of\ntheir funding — whether, if funding from the common provider\nwere to become unavailable, an alternative provider could not be\nfound.\n(2) However, even if it is established, based on subrule (1), that 2 or more\nof the firm’s counterparties are in a relationship of economic\ninterdependence, the firm need not treat them as a group of connected\ncounterparties if the firm can show the Regulatory Authority that despite\nthe interdependence, either counterparty could overcome financial\ndifficulties, or even the other counterparty’s default, by finding other\ncustomers or funding sources within a reasonable period.\nGuidance\nIf the sum of all of a banking business firm’s exposures to a particular counterparty is\nmore than 5% of the firm’s tier 1 capital, the firm should investigate the relationships\nbetween all of its counterparties (other than exempted counterparties) to determine\nwhether any 2 or more of them form a group of connected counterparties because of a\nrelationship of economic interdependence. For the meaning of tier 1 capital, see rule\n3.2.7 (2).\n5.2.8 Regulatory Authority can create relationships\nIf the Regulatory Authority considers it necessary or desirable to do so\nin the interests of the effective supervision of a banking business firm,\nthe Authority may direct the firm to treat a counterparty as connected to\nanother counterparty.\nDivision 5.2.C Management of large exposures\n5.2.9 Limits on large exposures\n(1) A banking business firm’s exposure to any 1 counterparty (except an\nexempted counterparty), or any 1 group of connected counterparties,\nmust not be greater than 25% of the firm’s tier 1 capital.\nNote For the meaning of tier 1 capital, see rule 3.2.7 (2).\npage 242 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.10\n(2) The total of all of the firm’s net large exposures must not exceed 800%\nof the firm’s tier 1 capital.\nNote The amount of any breach of a large exposure limit must be deducted from\nCET 1 capital — see rule 3.2.39.\n5.2.10 Exposures that would breach limit — approval by\nRegulatory Authority\n(1) A banking business firm may apply to the Regulatory Authority for the\napproval of an exposure that is greater than a large exposure limit.\n(2) The Authority will grant the approval only in exceptional\ncircumstances and only after the firm satisfies the Authority that the\nproposed exposure does not expose the firm to excessive risk.\n(3) If the Authority approves the exposure, the Authority may increase any\n1 or more of the firm’s minimum capital adequacy ratios to compensate\nfor the additional risk associated with the exposure.\nNote 1 For the meaning of minimum capital adequacy ratios, see rule 3.2.6.\nNote 2 The firm must deduct, from CET 1 capital, the amount by which the limit\nwas exceeded, unless the Authority has approved the excess — see\nrule 3.2.39.\n5.2.11 Breaches of limits — reporting and rectification\nIf a banking business firm breaches a large exposure limit:\n(a) it must immediately report the matter to the Regulatory Authority;\nand\n(b) it must take immediate action to rectify the breach.\n5.2.12 Periodic reporting of large exposures etc\n(1) A banking business firm must report the following to the Regulatory\nAuthority:\n(a) each of the firm’s exposures (other than exempted exposures) to\nany 1 counterparty, or any 1 group of connected counterparties,\nthat is equal to 10% or more of the firm’s tier 1 capital;\n(b) each of the firm’s exposures (other than exempted exposures) to\nany 1 counterparty, or any 1 group of connected counterparties,\nthat is equal to 10% or more of the firm’s tier 1 capital if the effect\nof credit risk mitigation is not taken into account;\n(c) every exempted exposure that is equal to 10% or more of the firm’s\ntier 1 capital;\nGuidance\nThe exposures that must be reported under paragraph (c) include exposures to\nexempted counterparties.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 243\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.13\n(d) the firm’s largest 20 exposures (other than exempted exposures) to\na single counterparty or a single group of connected counterparties,\nregardless of the values of those exposures relative to the firm’s\ntier 1 capital.\n(2) The reporting period for subrule (1) is to be as agreed with, or directed\nby, the Authority.\nDivision 5.2.D Exposure measurement\nSubdivision 5.2.D.1 General\n5.2.13 What claims, commitments and contingent liabilities must\nbe taken into account\n(1) When a banking business firm calculates its exposure to a counterparty\nor group of connected counterparties, the firm must take into account\nevery claim, commitment or contingent liability (other than a claim,\ncommitment or contingent liability that is or gives rise to an exempted\nexposure) that it would be required to take into account when\ncalculating its risk-based capital requirement.\nNote For how to calculate the firm’s risk-based capital requirement, see rule 3.2.5.\n(2) The firm must take into account every such claim, commitment or\nliability on or off the firm’s balance sheet, and whether in the firm’s\nbanking book or its trading book.\n5.2.14 Calculating exposure — general rules\n(1) This rule sets out how to calculate, for this Part, a banking business\nfirm’s exposure arising from a claim, commitment or contingent\nliability.\n(2) In general, except in the cases mentioned in subrules (3) to (5), the\namount of the exposure is the accounting value (net of specific\nprovisions and value adjustments) of the claim, commitment or liability.\n(3) If the exposure arises from an instrument that gives rise to counterparty\ncredit risk and is not an SFT, the firm’s exposure is the exposure at\ndefault for the instrument (see Part 4.6A).\n(4) If the exposure arises from an SFT, the firm’s exposure is the amount\ncalculated in accordance with the comprehensive approach in\nSubdivision 4.5.B.3.\n(5) If the exposure arises from an off-balance-sheet item, the firm’s\nexposure is the item’s credit equivalent amount, calculated in\naccordance with Division 4.4.C. In calculating the item’s credit\nequivalent amount, however, a minimum CCF of 10% must be used.\npage 244 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.15\n5.2.15 Eligible CRM techniques\n(1) For this Part, when a banking business firm is calculating the amount of\nits exposure from a claim, commitment or contingent liability:\n(a) it must apply any CRM technique that applies to the claim,\ncommitment or liability, and that the firm would apply when\ncalculating its risk-weighted capital requirement; but\n(b) it must not take into account any other CRM technique.\nNote Under Part 4.5, the firm may apply any of the following CRM techniques:\n• eligible collateral (see Division 4.5.B) in either the simple or the\ncomprehensive approach\n• an eligible guarantee (see Division 4.5.C)\n• an eligible credit derivative (see Division 4.5.D).\n(2) The firm must reduce the value of the exposure to the original\ncounterparty by the recognised amount (that is, the amount by which the\ntechnique reduced the exposure for risk-based capital requirements\npurposes).\nGuidance\nThe recognised amount is:\n• for unfunded credit protection — the value of the protected portion\n• for eligible collateral, if the firm uses the simple approach (see\nSubdivision 4.5.B.2) to calculate its risk-based capital requirement — the value\nof the part of the claim that is collateralised by the market value of the collateral\n• for eligible collateral, if the firm uses the comprehensive approach (see\nSubdivision 4.5.B.3) to calculate its risk-based capital requirement — the value\nof the adjusted collateral after applying the haircuts required under the\ncomprehensive approach\n• for an instrument that gives rise to counterparty credit risk (such as an OTC\nderivative) —the value of the collateral (see Part 4.6A).\n5.2.16 Exposure to CRM providers\nIf under this Part a banking business firm must recognise the reduction\nof an exposure by a CRM technique, it must also recognise an exposure\nto the CRM provider. The amount of the exposure to the CRM provider\nis the amount by which the exposure to the original counterparty or\ngroup is reduced.\n5.2.17 Claims etc hedged subject to maturity mismatch\n(1) For this Part, if a claim, commitment or contingent liability is hedged\nbut the hedge is subject to a maturity mismatch, the hedge is to be taken\ninto account only if:\n(a) the original maturities of both the claim, commitment or\ncontingent liability and the hedge are 1 year or longer; and\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 245\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.18\n(b) the residual maturity of the hedge is at least 3 months.\n(2) If a banking business firm has a maturity mismatch in relation to a CRM\ntechnique that the firm can apply in calculating its risk-based capital\nrequirement, then, for the purposes of this Part, the firm must adjust the\ncredit protection provided by the technique in the same way as it would\nwhen calculating its risk-based capital requirement.\n5.2.18 Effect of netting\nIf a banking business firm has legally enforceable netting arrangements\nfor loans and deposits, the firm may calculate the relevant exposure\nvalues for the purposes of this Part in the same way as it would to\ncalculate its risk-based capital requirement — that is, on the basis of the\nnet credit exposures, subject to the conditions in Division 4.5.E for\nnetting on the balance sheet.\n5.2.19 Investments in collective investment undertakings etc —\nwhether look-through required\n(1) If a banking business firm has invested in a structure through an entity\nthat itself has exposures to assets, the firm must look through the\nstructure to identify the underlyings unless:\n(a) the firm can show that the amount of its exposure to each\nunderlying is less than 0.25% of its tier 1 capital; or\n(b) the firm’s whole investment in the structure is less than 0.25% of\nits tier 1 capital.\nGuidance\nSuch structures include funds, securitisations and other structures with underlying\nassets.\nNote For the meaning of tier 1 capital, see rule 3.2.7 (2).\n(2) The firm must be able to show that a decision not to look through the\nstructure was not influenced by considerations of regulatory arbitrage\n(for example, it must be able to show that it did not circumvent a large\nexposure limit by investing in several smaller transactions that have\nidentical underlying assets).\n5.2.20 Investments in collective investment undertakings etc —\ncounterparty\n(1) This rule sets out how a banking business firm must assign an\nunderlying to its investment in a structure.\n(2) For this rule:\n(a) the firm must consider only exposures to underlyings that result\nfrom its investment in the structure itself; and\npage 246 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.20\n(b) the value of an exposure is to be calculated as set out in rule 5.2.22.\n(3) If, under rule 5.2.19, the firm is not required to look through the\nstructure to identify the underlyings, the firm must treat the structure\nitself as its counterparty.\n(4) If, under rule 5.2.19, the firm is required to look through the structure\nto identify the underlyings:\n(a) for any underlying for which the exposure value is equal to 0.25%\nor more of the firm’s tier 1 capital, and the counterparty is\nidentifiable, the firm must treat that counterparty as its\ncounterparty;\n(b) for any underlying for which the exposure value is less than 0.25%\nof the firm’s tier 1 capital, the firm may treat the structure itself as\nits counterparty;\n(c) for any underlying for which the firm cannot identify the\ncounterparty, it must assign that total amount to “the unknown\nclient”; and\n(d) for any underlying for which the firm cannot calculate the\nexposure amount, the firm must assign the nominal amount of its\nexposure to “the unknown client”.\n(5) The firm’s exposure to a counterparty under this rule must be added to\nany other direct or indirect exposure to that counterparty.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 247\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.21\n(6) Exposures that have been assigned to “the unknown client” must be\naggregated as if “the unknown client” were a single counterparty. The\nlarge exposure limits apply to exposures to “the unknown client”.\nGuidance\nThe following flow chart summarises the effect of rule 5.2.20:\n5.2.21 Investments in collective investment undertakings etc —\nlook-through not required — value\n(1) This rule applies to a banking business firm’s investment in a structure\nif, under rule 5.2.19, the firm is not required to look through the structure\nto identify the underlying assets.\n(2) The firm’s exposure to the structure is taken to be the nominal amount\nthat it has invested in the structure.\n5.2.22 Investments in collective investment undertakings etc —\nlook-through required — value\n(1) This rule applies to a banking business firm’s investment in a structure\nif, under rule 5.2.19, the firm is required to look through the structure to\nidentify the underlying assets.\n(2) The exposure value assigned to a counterparty is equal to the pro rata\nshare that the firm holds in the structure multiplied by the value of the\nunderlying asset.\nGuidance\nThus, if the firm holds a 1% share of a structure that invests in 20 assets each with a\nvalue of 5, it must assign an exposure of 0.05 to each of the counterparties. An\npage 248 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.23\nexposure to a counterparty must be added to any other direct or indirect exposures the\nbank has to that counterparty.\n(3) In the case of a tranched structure, the firm must measure its exposure\nvalue to a counterparty for each tranche within the structure, assuming\na pro rata distribution of losses amongst investors in the tranche. To\ncompute the exposure value to the underlying, the firm:\n(a) must first find the lower of:\n(i) the value of the tranche in which the bank invests; and\n(ii) the nominal value of each underlying in the portfolio; and\n(b) must then apply the pro rata share of the firm’s investment in the\ntranche to the value determined in the first step.\n5.2.23 Additional risk factors — role of third parties\n(1) A banking business firm must identify any risk inherent in a structure in\nrelation to an exposure (such as having an originator, fund manager,\nliquidity provider or credit protection provider) in common. The firm\nmust consider:\n(a) whether the connection by way of that entity should be treated as\nan additional risk factor; and\n(b) whether the relevant exposures should be treated as exposures to a\ngroup of connected counterparties.\nGuidance\nIn some cases, the manager would be regarded as a distinct counterparty so that the\nsum of a firm’s investments in all of the funds managed by that manager would be\nsubject to the large exposure limits. But in other cases, the commonality of the\nmanager might not be an additional risk factor — for example, the legal framework\nthat governs the fund might separate the legal entity that manages the fund and the\nlegal entity that has custody of its assets. In the case of a structured finance product,\nthe liquidity provider or sponsor of a short-term programme (such as an asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduit or a structured investment vehicle) may need to be\nconsidered as an additional risk factor. Similarly, in synthetic financial instruments, a\nprotection provider may be an additional source of risk and a common factor for\nconnecting different structures.\n(2) The firm must also consider whether an entity referred to in subrule (1)\nis connected closely enough to a counterparty of the firm that the entity\nand the counterparty should be treated as a group of connected\ncounterparties.\nGuidance\n1 If the firm has investments in a set of structures associated with a third party that\nconstitutes a common risk factor, the firm might have to consider adding the\ninvestments to other exposures (such as a loan) to that party. Whether it is\nnecessary to do so depends on a case-by-case consideration of the specific\nfeatures of the structure and on the role of the third party.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 249\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.24\n2 In the example of the fund manager, adding together the exposures may not be\nnecessary because fraudulent behaviour by the fund manager would not\nnecessarily affect the repayment of a loan. The assessment may be different\nwhere the risk to the value of investments underlying the structures arises in the\nevent of a third-party default. For example, in the case of a credit protection\nprovider, the source of the additional risk for the firm’s investing in a structure is\nthe default of the credit protection provider. The firm should add the investment\nin the structure to the direct exposures to the credit protection provider since both\nexposures might crystallise into losses in the event that the protection provider\ndefaults (ignoring the covered part of the exposures may lead to the undesirable\nsituation of a high risk concentration exposure to issuers of collateral or providers\nof credit protection).\n(3) If the firm considers 2 or more third parties to be potential sources of\nadditional risk, the firm must assign the exposure resulting from the\ninvestment in each relevant structure to each of the third parties.\n5.2.24 Exposure value of covered bonds\n(1) In this rule:\ncovered bond has the same meaning as in rule 4.4.74 (1).\nqualifying covered bond means a covered bond that meets the following\nrequirements:\n(a) the underlying assets (the cover pool) include only assets of the\nfollowing kinds:\n(i) claims on, or guaranteed by, sovereigns, central banks, PSEs\nor MDBs;\n(ii) claims secured by residential real estate in relation to which\nthe prudential requirements in rule 4.4.56 have been\ncomplied with, and with an LTV ratio of 80% or lower;\n(iii) claims secured by commercial real estate in relation to which\nthose prudential requirements have been complied with, and\nwith an LTV ratio of 60% or lower;\n(iv) additional collateral of the following kinds:\n(A) substitution assets (that is, cash or short-term liquid and\nsecure assets held in substitution for the primary assets\nto top up the cover pool for management purposes);\n(B) derivatives entered into to hedge the risks arising in the\ncovered bond programme;\n(b) the total nominal value of the cover pool is at least 10% more than\nthe total nominal value of outstanding bonds issued (but see\nsubrule (2));\npage 250 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.25\n(c) the bonds met the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) when they\nwere issued and will continue to do so until their maturity;\n(d) for any real estate that is part of the assets in the cover pool, the\nfollowing requirements are satisfied:\n(i) the real estate is valued at no more than the current fair value\nunder which it could be sold under private contract between\na willing seller and an arm’s-length buyer on the date of\nvaluation;\n(ii) the firm assesses the value of the real estate frequently (at\nleast annually), or more frequently if the market is subject to\nsignificant changes in conditions.\n(2) For paragraph (b) of the definition of qualifying covered bond, an issue\nis taken to meet the requirement as to the value of the cover pool if:\n(a) the legislation that governs the bonds requires the value of the\ncover pool to meet that requirement; or\n(b) if that legislation contains no such requirement — the issuer\nregularly states publicly that the value of the cover pool meets that\nrequirement.\n(3) A banking business firm may assign, to a holding of qualifying covered\nbonds, an exposure value equal to 20% of the nominal value of the\nholding.\n(4) A banking business firm must assign, to a holding of covered bonds that\nare not qualifying covered bonds, an exposure value equal to 100% of\nthe nominal value of the holding.\n(5) The counterparty to the exposure is the issuer of the bonds.\n5.2.25 Exposures to central counterparties that are not QCCPs\n(1) This rule relates to a banking business firm’s exposures to central\ncounterparties that are not QCCPs.\nNote 1 Exposures to QCCPs that are related to clearing are exempted exposures —\nsee rule 5.2.2, definition of exempted exposures, paragraph (e).\nNote 2 For the meaning of QCCP, see the Glossary.\n(2) A banking business firm must measure its exposure to such a central\ncounterparty as the sum of the firm’s clearing exposures and non-\nclearing exposures to the central counterparty.\n(3) For the purpose of deciding whether a QCCP is part of a group of\nconnected counterparties, exposures that are related only to clearing\nactivities are to be disregarded. However, non-clearing exposures are to\nbe taken into account for that purpose.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 251\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.26\n(4) A banking business firm must identify its exposures to a QCCP that are\nrelated to clearing activities and must add those exposures together. The\ntypes of exposures that are related to clearing activities, and the value to\nbe assigned to each, are as set out in table 5.2.25.\nTable 5.2.25 Exposures related to clearing — values\nType of exposure Value\nTrade exposures the value calculated according\nto the relevant provisions of\nDivisions 4.4.B and 4.4.C for\nthe type of exposure\nSegregated initial margin 0\nNon-segregated initial margin the nominal amount posted\nPre-funded default fund the nominal amount of the\ncontributions contribution\nUnfunded default fund 0\ncontributions\nEquity stakes the nominal amount\n(5) For an exposure that is directly related to clearing activities (such as the\nfirm acting as a clearing member or being a client of a clearing member),\nthe firm must determine the counterparty to which the exposure must be\nassigned by applying the relevant provisions of Part 4.6A.\n(6) For an exposure to a QCCP that is not directly related to a clearing\nservice provided by the QCCP (such as a funding facility, credit facility\nor guarantee), the value must be determined, according to the rules in\nthis Part, in the same way as for any other counterparty.\nSubdivision 5.2.D.2 Exposures in trading book\n5.2.26 Exposures in both banking and trading book to same\ncounterparty\nIf a banking business firm has exposures to a particular counterparty in\nboth its banking book and trading book, the firm must add all of the\nexposures to the counterparty to calculate its total exposure to that\ncounterparty.\n5.2.27 Values of exposures for trading book positions\n(1) The exposures considered in this rule correspond to the risk\nconcentrations associated with the default of a single counterparty for\npage 252 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.28\nexposures in the trading book. Therefore, positions in financial\ninstruments such as bonds and equities are subject to the large exposure\nlimits, but positions in a particular commodity or currency are not.\n(2) The exposure value of a debt or equity instrument is the market value of\nthe instrument.\n(3) Instruments such as swaps, futures, forwards and credit derivatives held\nin the trading book must be converted into positions in the same way as\nwhen calculating the firm’s risk-based capital requirement. Such\ninstruments must be decomposed into their individual legs, and a leg is\nto be disregarded if it represents an exposure that need not, under rule\n5.2.13, be taken into account for this Part.\nGuidance\nA stock futures contract on stock X, for example, is decomposed into a long position\nin stock X and a short position in a risk-free interest rate exposure in the funding\ncurrency. A typical interest rate swap is decomposed into a long position in a fixed\ninterest rate exposure and a short position in a floating one, or vice versa.\n(4) For a credit derivative that represents sold protection, the exposure to\nthe referenced name is the difference between the amount that would be\ndue if the protection were triggered and the absolute market value of the\ncredit protection.\nGuidance\nIf the market value of a credit derivative is positive for the protection seller, that value\nshould also be added to the protection seller’s exposure to the protection buyer. Such\na situation could occur if the present value of agreed but unpaid premiums exceeded\nthe absolute market value of the credit protection.\n(5) For a credit-linked note for which the firm is the protection seller, the\nfirm must consider positions in both the issuer and the underlying that\nthe note references.\n5.2.28 Exposure values of options in trading book\n(1) For this Part, the exposure value of an option held in the trading book is\nthe change in price that would result from a default of the underlying\ninstrument.\n(2) For a call option, the exposure value is the market value of the option.\nFor a long call, the value is positive and for a short call it is negative.\n(3) For a put option, the exposure value is the option’s strike price minus\nits market value. For a short put, the value is positive and for a long put\nit is negative.\n(4) The firm must add the resulting positions to its other exposures. After\naggregation, negative net exposures must be treated as being zero.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 253\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.29\n5.2.29 Exposure values of investments in transactions in trading\nbook\n(1) This rule deals with how a banking business firm must decide the\nexposure value of an investment in a transaction (such as an index\nposition, a securitisation, a hedge fund or an investment fund) that is\nheld in the firm’s trading book.\n(2) The firm must calculate the exposure value of such an investment in the\nsame way as for a similar instrument in the firm’s banking book.\n5.2.30 Treatment of long and short positions in trading book —\npositions in same issue\nFor this Part, a banking business firm may offset long and short\npositions in the same issue (for this rule, 2 issues are the same if the\nissuer, coupon, currency and maturity are identical). The firm may treat\nthe net position as being its exposure to the issuer.\n5.2.31 Treatment of long and short positions in trading book —\npositions in different issues from same counterparty\n(1) A banking business firm may offset positions in different issues by the\nsame counterparty only if:\n(a) the short position is junior to the long position; or\n(b) the positions are of the same seniority.\n(2) To determine the relative seniority of positions, the firm may allocate\npositions to broad classes based on seniority — for example, “equity”,\n“subordinated debt” and “senior debt”.\n(3) If the firm chooses not to allocate its positions to classes as set out in\nsubrule (2), it must not offset long and short positions in different issues\nby the counterparty.\n(4) If the result of the offsetting is a net short position with a single\ncounterparty, that net position need not be treated as an exposure for the\npurposes of this Part.\n5.2.32 Treatment of hedged positions in trading book\n(1) If a banking business firm’s position is hedged by a credit derivative,\nthe firm may take the hedge into account if, for the underlying and the\nposition hedged, the short position is junior to the long position, or the\npositions are of the same seniority. Subrules 5.2.31 (2) and (3) apply.\n(2) If a banking business firm’s exposure is hedged by a credit derivative,\nany reduction in exposure to the original counterparty is also an\npage 254 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.33\nexposure to the credit protection provider, in accordance with\nrule 5.2.16, except in the case mentioned in subrule (3).\n(3) If the hedge takes the form of a credit default swap (CDS) and either the\nCDS provider or the referenced entity is not a financial entity, the\namount to be assigned to the CDS provider is, instead, the counterparty\ncredit risk exposure value calculated according to Part 4.6A.\n(4) In subrule (3):\nfinancial entity means:\n(a) a regulated financial institution (that is, a corporate group in which\nan entity is supervised by a financial regulator that imposes\nprudential requirements consistent with international standards);\nor\nGuidance\nRegulated financial institutions include, but are not limited to, prudentially\nregulated insurance companies, broker/dealers, banks, thrifts and futures\ncommission merchants.\n(b) a legal entity whose main business is the management of financial\nassets, lending, factoring, leasing, the provision of credit\nenhancements, securitisation, investments, financial custody,\ncentral counterparty services, proprietary trading and any other\nfinancial service activity specified by the Regulatory Authority by\nnotice published on an approved website.\n5.2.33 No netting between banking and trading books\nA banking business firm must not net positions between the banking\nbook and trading book.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 255\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.1 General\nRule 6.1.1\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.1 General\nDivision 6.1.A Management of market risk generally\n6.1.1 Introduction\n(1) This Chapter sets out the requirements for a banking business firm’s\nmarket risk management policy to identify, measure, evaluate, manage\nand control or mitigate market risk. This Chapter also sets out how to\ncalculate the firm’s market risk capital requirement.\n(2) A banking business firm that operates in a market incurs risks from\npotential movements in market prices.\n(3) The market risk capital requirement for a banking business firm is\nmade up of capital charges for:\n(a) foreign exchange risk in the banking book and trading book;\n(b) options risk in the banking book and trading book;\n(c) commodities risk in the banking book and trading book;\n(d) traded equity position risk; and\n(e) traded interest rate risk.\nNote The measurements of the risks mentioned in subrule (3) are set out in\nPart 6.2 to Part 6.6.\n6.1.2 Requirements—capital and management of market risk\n(1) A banking business firm must have capital to cover market risk from\npositions in its banking and trading books.\n(2) The firm must also have robust market risk measurement and risk\nmanagement.\n6.1.3 Standard method to be used\n(1) Unless the Regulatory Authority has approved the use of an internal\nmodel by a banking business firm, market risk is, as a general rule,\nmeasured using the standard method. The standard method comprises\na range of approaches that a firm may use to calculate capital charges\nfrom its trading activities.\nNote For approval of the use of internal models—see rule 3.1.6.\n(2) In the standard method, capital requirement is the sum of the capital\ncharges, calculated in accordance with this Chapter, for the risks\nincluded in market risk.\npage 256 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nGeneral Part 6.1\nRule 6.1.5\n6.1.5 Role of governing body—market risk\nA banking business firm’s governing body must ensure that the firm’s\nmarket risk management policy enables the firm to obtain a\ncomprehensive firm-wide view of its market risk and takes into account\nthe risk of a significant deterioration in market liquidity.\n6.1.6 Policies—market risk environment\n(1) A banking business firm’s market risk management policy must\nestablish:\n(a) effective systems for the accurate and timely identification,\nmeasurement, evaluation, management and control or mitigation\nof market risk, and reporting to the firm’s governing body and\nsenior management;\n(b) prudent and appropriate market risk limits that are consistent with\nthe firm’s risk appetite, risk profile and capital, and with the\nmanagement’s ability to manage;\n(c) who is responsible for identifying, measuring and reporting market\nrisk;\n(d) procedures for tracking and reporting exceptions to, and deviations\nfrom, limits or policies; and\n(e) procedures for including positions and exposures in the trading\nbook.\n(2) The policy must ensure that all of the firm’s transactions are identified\nand recorded in a timely way and that their valuations are consistent and\nprudent. The firm must use reliable market data that have been verified\nby a function that is independent of the function that assumed or\nincurred the risk.\nGuidance\nIn the absence of market prices, the firm may use industry-accepted models to value\ntransactions.\n6.1.9 Relation to stress-testing\nWhen carrying out stress-testing or review of stress scenarios, a banking\nbusiness firm must take into account market risk exposures.\n6.1.10 Capital requirement, assets and liabilities\n(1) In calculating its capital requirement, a banking business firm must take\ninto account unexpected losses that may arise from market risk.\n(2) In determining the value of an asset or liability, the firm must also make\nappropriate adjustments for uncertainties arising from market risk.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 257\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.1 General\nRule 6.1.11\nDivision 6.1.B Measurement of risk and valuation of\npositions\n6.1.11 Valuing positions—mark-to-market\n(1) A banking business firm must use the mark-to-market method to value\nits positions and exposures if there is a market to mark the positions and\nexposures to. Mark-to-market means a valuation that is based on\ncurrent market value.\nGuidance\n1 The Regulatory Authority would expect a banking business firm to mark-to-\nmarket listed securities since there is a market with observable and reliable prices\nfor such securities.\n2 The firm should mark-to-market as much as possible. It should use the prudent\nside of bid or offer unless the firm is a significant market maker that can close at\nmid-market.\n3 When estimating fair value, the firm should maximise the use of relevant\nobservable inputs and avoid the use of unobservable inputs.\n(2) A position that is marked-to-market must be revalued daily, based on\nindependently sourced current market prices.\n6.1.12 Valuing positions—mark-to-model\n(1) If it is not possible to mark-to-market (for example, in the case of\nunlisted securities or where the market is inactive), a banking business\nfirm may use the mark-to-model method to value its positions and\nexposures. Mark-to-model means a valuation that has to be\nbenchmarked, extrapolated or otherwise calculated from a market input.\n(2) The firm must be able to demonstrate that its marking-to-model is\nprudent.\nGuidance\nA banking business firm should be extra conservative when marking-to-model. The\nRegulatory Authority will take into account the following in deciding if the firm’s\nmodel is prudent:\n• whether senior management is aware of the positions and exposures that are\nmarked to model and whether it understands the uncertainty this might create in\nreporting the risk or performance of the business\n• the extent to which market inputs are sourced from market prices\n• the appropriateness of the assumptions used by the firm\n• the availability of generally accepted valuation methods for particular products\n• who developed the model\n• whether the firm holds a secure copy of the model\n• the existence of formal control procedures for changing the model\n• how often the model is used to check valuations\npage 258 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nGeneral Part 6.1\nRule 6.1.13\n• how aware is the firm’s risk management function of the weaknesses of the model\nand how those weaknesses are reflected in the valuation output\n• the results of comparisons between actual close out values and model outputs\n• the firm’s procedures for reviewing the model.\n6.1.13 Independent price verification\nA banking business firm must independently verify market prices and\nmodel inputs, to check that those prices and inputs are accurate. The\nverification must be done at least once a month.\nGuidance\n1 Independent price verification is different from daily mark-to-market. The object\nof the verification is to regularly check the accuracy of market prices or model\ninputs and, thereby, eliminate inaccurate daily marks. The verification should be\ncarried out by a unit independent of whoever marked the positions or exposures.\n2 The independent marking in the verification process should reveal any error or\nbias in pricing. It entails a higher standard of accuracy in that the market prices\nor model inputs are used to determine profit and loss figures, whereas daily marks\nare used primarily for management reporting in between reporting dates.\n6.1.14 Valuation adjustments\n(1) A banking business firm must consider making adjustments for\npositions that cannot be prudently valued (such as those that have\nbecome concentrated, less liquid or stale). For example, valuation\nadjustment would be appropriate if pricing sources are more subjective\n(such as when there is only one available broker quote).\n(2) The firm must establish and maintain procedures for considering\nvaluation adjustments. This rule applies whether:\n(a) the firm uses the mark-to-market or mark-to-model method; and\n(b) whether the valuation is done by the firm itself or a third party.\n(3) The firm must consider the following valuation adjustments:\n(a) unearned profit;\n(b) close-out costs;\n(c) operational risks;\n(d) early termination;\n(e) investing and funding costs;\n(f) future administrative costs;\n(g) model risk, if relevant;\n(h) any other adjustment that the firm considers appropriate.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 259\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.1 General\nRule 6.1.15\nDivision 6.1.C Internal risk transfers\n6.1.15 Meaning of internal risk transfer\nAn internal risk transfer is an internal written record of a transfer of\nrisk:\n(a) within a banking business firm’s banking book;\n(b) between the firm’s banking and trading book; or\n(c) between different desks within the trading book.\n6.1.16 Capital effect of internal risk transfer from trading book to\nbanking book\nAn internal risk transfer from the trading book to the banking book has\nno effect on the risk-based capital requirement of the banking business\nfirm concerned. That is, if the firm makes an internal risk transfer from\nthe trading book to the banking book, the transfer is not to be taken into\naccount when the firm calculates its risk-based capital requirement.\n6.1.17 Capital effect of internal risk transfer of credit and equity\nrisk from banking book to trading book\n(1) This rule applies if a banking business firm hedges a credit risk or equity\nrisk exposure in the banking book using a hedging instrument that was\npurchased through the trading book (that is, using an internal risk\ntransfer).\n(2) A credit exposure in the banking book is taken to be hedged for the\npurpose of calculating the firm’s risk-based capital requirement if and\nonly if:\n(a) the trading book enters into an external hedge with an eligible\nprotection provider (see subrule (4)) that exactly matches the\ninternal risk transfer; and\n(b) the external hedge is an eligible credit derivative (see subrule (4))\nin relation to the banking book exposure.\n(3) An equity exposure in the banking book is taken to be hedged for that\npurpose if and only if:\n(a) the trading book enters into an external hedge from an eligible\nprotection provider that exactly matches the internal risk transfer;\nand\n(b) the external hedge is recognised as a hedge of a banking book\nequity exposure.\npage 260 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nGeneral Part 6.1\nRule 6.1.18\n(4) In subrules (2) and (3):\neligible credit derivative has the meaning given by rule 4.5.34.\neligible protection provider has the meaning given by rule 4.6.35 (2).\n(5) For the purposes of this rule, an external hedge may be made up of\nmultiple transactions with multiple counterparties as long as the total\nexternal hedge exactly matches the internal risk transfer.\n(6) If the requirements in subrule (2) are satisfied, the banking book\nexposure is treated, for capital purposes in the banking book, as being\nhedged by the banking book leg of the transfer. Both the trading book\nleg of the transfer and the external hedge must be included in the market\nrisk capital requirements.\n(7) If the requirements in subrule (2) are not satisfied, the banking book\nexposure is not treated, for capital purposes in the banking book, as\nbeing hedged by the banking book leg of the transfer. The third-party\nexternal hedge must be fully included in, and the trading book leg of the\ntransfer must be fully excluded from, the market risk capital\nrequirements.\n(8) A banking book short credit or equity position that was created by an\ninternal risk transfer and is not capitalised under banking book rules\nmust be capitalised under the market risk rules together with the trading\nbook exposure.\nGuidance\nA banking book instrument that is over-hedged by an internal risk transfer creates a\nshort (risk) position in the banking book.\n6.1.18 Internal risk transfer of general interest rate risk\n(1) This rule applies if a banking business firm hedges a general interest\nrate risk (GIRR) exposure in the banking book using an internal risk\ntransfer with its trading book.\n(2) The trading book leg of the transfer is treated as a trading book\ninstrument under the market risk framework if (and only if):\n(a) the transfer is documented in relation to the interest rate risk that\nis being hedged and the sources of that risk;\n(b) the transfer is done with a dedicated internal risk transfer trading\ndesk that has been specifically approved by the Regulatory\nAuthority for the purpose; and\n(c) the transfer is subject to trading book capital requirements under\nthe market risk framework on a stand-alone basis for the dedicated\ninternal risk transfer desk, separate from any other GIRR or other\nmarket risks generated by activities in the trading book.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 261\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.1 General\nRule 6.1.19\n(3) If the requirements in subrule (2) are satisfied, the banking book leg of\nthe transfer must be included in the banking book’s measure of interest\nrate risk exposures for regulatory capital purposes.\n(4) The internal risk transfer desk may include instruments purchased from\nthe market. Such purchases may be executed directly between the desk\nand the market.\n(5) Alternatively, the internal risk transfer desk may obtain the external\nhedge from the market by a separate non-internal risk transfer trading\ndesk acting as an agent, if and only if the GIRR internal risk transfer\nentered into with the non-internal desk exactly matches the external\nhedge from the market. In this case the respective legs of the GIRR\ninternal risk transfer are included in the capital calculations of both the\ninternal risk transfer desk and the non-internal risk transfer desk.\n6.1.19 Internal risk transfers within scope of application of market\nrisk capital requirement\n(1) Internal risk transfers between a banking business firm’s internal risk\ntransfer desk and other trading desks receive regulatory capital\nrecognition only if the conditions in rule 6.1.18 (2) are satisfied.\n(2) The trading book leg of an internal risk transfer must fulfil the same\nrequirements in rule 6.1.18 (2) as an instrument in the trading book\ntransacted with an external counterparty.\npage 262 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nForeign exchange risk Part 6.2\nRule 6.2.1\nPart 6.2 Foreign exchange risk\n6.2.1 Relation to market risk\n(1) In measuring its market risk, a banking business firm must include the\nrisk of holding or taking positions in foreign currencies and gold\n(foreign exchange risk). Foreign exchange risk may arise from the\nfirm’s trading in the foreign exchange market and other markets; it may\nalso arise from non-trading activities that are denominated in a foreign\ncurrency.\nGuidance\n1 If a banking business firm is exposed to interest rate risk on positions in foreign\ncurrencies and gold, the firm must include the relevant interest rate positions in\nthe calculation of interest rate risk—see rule 6.6.2 (4).\n2 Gold is dealt with as a foreign exchange position (rather than as a commodity\nposition) because the volatility of its prices is similar to that of a currency.\n(2) If foreign currency is to be received or delivered under a forward\ncontract, the firm must report any interest rate exposure from the other\nleg of the contract in accordance with Part 6.6 (traded interest rate risk).\n(3) If gold is to be received or delivered under a forward contract, the firm\nmust report any foreign currency or interest rate exposure from the other\nleg of the contract in accordance with this Part or Part 6.6, respectively.\n6.2.2 What to include in foreign exchange risk\n(1) In calculating the capital charge for foreign exchange risk, a banking\nbusiness firm must include in its exposure to each foreign currency:\n(a) the net spot position (that is, assets minus liabilities denominated\nin the currency, including accrued interest and other accrued\nincome and accrued expenses);\n(b) the net forward position (that is, amounts to be received minus\namounts to be paid under forward foreign exchange transactions\ndenominated in the currency);\nExamples of amounts to be received or paid\n• payments under currency futures\n• the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position\n• interest from futures, swaps and other interest rate transactions.\n(c) irrevocable guarantees (and similar instruments) that are certain to\nbe called and likely to be irrecoverable; and\n(d) any other items representing an exposure to risk in foreign\ncurrencies (for example, a specific provision held in the currency\nin question where the underlying asset is held in a different\ncurrency).\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 263\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.2 Foreign exchange risk\nRule 6.2.3\n(2) The firm may also include in its currency exposure any net future\nincome or expenses that are not yet accrued but already fully hedged. If\nthe firm includes such income or expenses, it must do so consistently\nand must not select only expected future flows that reduce its position.\n(3) If the firm has deliberately taken a position to partly or totally protect\nitself against the adverse effect of a change in an exchange rate on its\ncapital adequacy ratio, it may exclude the position from its currency\nexposure insofar as it relates to that hedge, if:\n(a) the position is of a structural and non-trading nature;\n(b) the structural position does no more than protect the firm’s capital\nadequacy ratio;\n(c) the position cannot be traded for speculative or profit-making\npurposes; and\n(d) the exclusion of the position is done consistently, with the\ntreatment of the hedge remaining the same for the life of the assets\nor other items.\n(4) A structural position includes:\n(a) a position arising from an instrument that satisfies the criteria for\ninclusion as capital under Chapter 3;\n(b) a position in relation to a net investment in a self-sustaining\nsubsidiary, the accounting consequence of which is to reduce or\neliminate what would otherwise be a movement in the foreign\ncurrency translation reserve; and\n(c) an investment in an overseas subsidiary or other entity in the same\ncorporate group as the banking business firm that, under these\nrules, is deducted from the firm’s capital for capital adequacy\npurposes.\n(5) A banking business firm must also include any currency exposures\narising from equity, commodity and interest positions.\n6.2.3 Foreign exchange risk on consolidated basis\n(1) If a banking business firm is assessing its foreign exchange risk on a\nconsolidated basis, and the inclusion of the currency positions of a\nmarginal operation of the firm is technically impractical, the firm may\nuse, as a proxy for those positions, the internal limit in each currency\nthat the firm applies to the operation. Marginal operation, in relation to\npage 264 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nForeign exchange risk Part 6.2\nRule 6.2.4\na firm, is an operation that accounts for less than 5% of the firm’s total\ncurrency positions.\n(2) The absolute values of the limits must be added to the net open position\nin each currency, but only if the actual positions are adequately\nmonitored against those internal limits.\n6.2.4 Capital charge—foreign exchange risk\n(1) For a banking business firm that does not write options, net open\nposition in a foreign currency is the sum of:\n(a) the firm’s currency exposures under rule 6.2.2 for the currency;\nand\n(b) the value of the options and their associated underlying assets\nmeasured using the simplified approach in Division 6.3.B.\n(2) For a banking business firm that writes options, net open position in a\nforeign currency is the sum of:\n(a) the firm’s currency exposures under rule 6.2.2 for the currency;\nand\n(b) either:\n(i) the net delta-based equivalent of the firm’s total book of\nforeign currency options (with separately calculated capital\ncharges for gamma risk and vega risk under Division 6.3.C);\nor\n(ii) the value of the options and their associated underlying assets\nunder the delta-plus method in Division 6.3.C.\n(3) A banking business firm must calculate its overall foreign currency net\nopen position by:\n(a) calculating the net open position in each foreign currency;\n(b) converting the nominal amount (or net present value) of each such\nnet position into Qatari riyals at the current spot market exchange\nrate;\n(c) adding all short net positions and adding all long net positions\ncalculated under paragraphs (a) and (b); and\n(d) selecting the greater of the absolute values of the 2 sums in\nparagraph (c).\n(4) The firm must then calculate its net position in gold by:\n(a) valuing all gold positions using the US dollar current spot price\n(regardless of maturity);\n(b) offsetting long and short positions; and\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 265\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.2 Foreign exchange risk\nRule 6.2.5\n(c) converting the absolute value of the resulting net position into\nQatari riyals.\n(5) To convert the net position in gold into Qatari riyals, the firm must state\nthe position (spot plus forward) in a standard unit of measurement and\nthen convert the net position at the current spot market exchange rate.\n(6) The capital charge for foreign exchange risk of a banking business firm\nis the sum of:\n(a) 8% of the firm’s overall foreign currency net open position in each\nof the foreign currencies it holds; and\n(b) 8% of its net position in gold.\n6.2.5 Forward positions\nA banking business firm must value forward currency and gold\npositions at the current spot market exchange rates.\n6.2.6 Treatment of paired currencies\nA banking business firm must report positions in a currency pair\nseparately as if each were a currency on its own.\npage 266 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nOptions risk Part 6.3\nRule 6.3.1\nPart 6.3 Options risk\nDivision 6.3.A General\n6.3.1 Relation to market risk\nIn measuring its market risk, a banking business firm must include the\nrisk of holding or taking positions in options contracts (options risk).\n6.3.2 Measuring options risk\n(1) A banking business firm that does not write options must use the\nsimplified approach.\n(2) A banking business firm that writes options must use the delta-plus\nmethod.\nNote If all the written option positions are hedged by perfectly matched long\npositions in exactly the same options, no capital charge for options risk is\nrequired.\nDivision 6.3.B Simplified approach\n6.3.3 Using simplified approach\nA banking business firm that does not write options must calculate\ncapital charges in accordance with:\n(a) rule 6.3.4 for a position that is a ‘long cash and long put’ or ‘short\ncash and long call’ position; or\n(b) rule 6.3.5 for a position that is a ‘long put’ or ‘long call’ position.\nGuidance\nIn the simplified approach, the position in the option and the associated underlying\nasset (cash or forward) is not subject to the standard method. Instead, each position is\ncarved-out and subject to a separately calculated capital charge for specific risk and\ngeneral risk.\nNote As a general rule, the standard method is used to measure market risk—see\nrule 6.1.3.\n6.3.4 Capital charges—‘long cash and long put’ or ‘short cash\nand long call’\n(1) For a position that is ‘long cash and long put’ or ‘short cash and long\ncall’, the capital charge is calculated by multiplying the market value of\nthe underlying security by the sum of the specific and general risk\ncapital charges for the underlying, and then subtracting the amount by\nwhich the option is in-the-money (bounded at zero).\nGuidance\n1 In cases (such as foreign exchange transactions) where it is unclear which side is\nthe underlying security, the underlying should be taken to be the asset that would\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 267\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.3 Options risk\nRule 6.3.5\nbe received if the option were exercised. In addition, the nominal value should be\nused for items if the market value of the underlying instrument could be zero\n(such as in caps, floors and swaptions).\n2 Some options have no specific risk (such as those having an interest rate, currency\nor commodity as the underlying security); other options on interest-rate-related\ninstruments and options on equities and stock indices, however, would have\nspecific risk.\n(2) In the simplified approach, the capital charge is:\n(a) 8% for options on currency; and\n(b) 15% for options on commodities.\n(3) For options with a residual maturity of less than 6 months, a banking\nbusiness firm must use the forward price (instead of the spot price) if it\nis able to do so.\n(4) For options with a residual maturity of more than 6 months, the firm\nmust compare the strike price with the forward price (instead of the\ncurrent price). If the firm is unable to do this, it must take the in-the-\nmoney amount to be zero.\n6.3.5 Capital charges—‘long put’ or ‘long call’\n(1) For a position that is ‘long put’ or ‘long call’, the capital charge is the\nlesser of:\n(a) the market value of the underlying security multiplied by the sum\nof the specific and general risk capital charges for the underlying;\nand\n(b) the market value of the option.\n(2) For subrule (1) (b), the book value of the option may be used instead of\nthe market value if the position is not included in the trading book (for\nexample, options on particular foreign exchange or commodities\npositions).\nDivision 6.3.C Delta-plus method\n6.3.6 Using delta-plus method\n(1) A banking business firm that writes options must calculate specific risk\ncapital charges separately by multiplying the delta-equivalent value of\neach option by the risk-weight applicable under Part 6.5 (traded equity\nposition risk) and Part 6.6 (traded interest rate risk).\n(2) In calculating general risk capital charge, the firm must enter delta-\nweighted positions with a debt security or interest rate as the underlying\ninto the interest rate time bands in table 6.6.8A by using a two-legged\napproach. Under this approach, there is 1 entry at the time the\npage 268 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nOptions risk Part 6.3\nRule 6.3.7\nunderlying contract takes effect and a second entry at the time the\nunderlying contract matures.\n(3) For an option with a debt security as the underlying, the firm must apply\na specific risk capital charge to the delta-weighted position based on the\nissuer’s rating and in accordance with Part 6.6.\n6.3.7 Relation to standard method\n(1) A banking business firm that writes options must include delta-weighted\noption positions in measuring its market risk.\n(2) The firm must report such an option as a position equal to the sum of\nthe market values of the underlying multiplied by the sum of the\nabsolute values of the deltas. Because delta does not cover all risks\nassociated with option positions, the firm must calculate gamma and\nvega in calculating the regulatory capital charge.\nNote Gamma is the rate of change of delta with respect to a change in the price\nof the underlying. Vega is the sensitivity of the value of an option to a change\nin the volatility of the underlying.\n(3) The firm must calculate delta, gamma and vega using the pricing model\nused by a recognised exchange, or a proprietary options pricing model\napproved, in writing, by the Regulatory Authority.\n6.3.8 Capital charges—options\n(1) The capital charge for an option with equities as the underlying must be\nbased on the delta-weighted positions included in the measurement of\nspecific and general risks in accordance with Part 6.5 (traded equity\nposition risk).\n(2) A banking business firm that writes options must calculate the capital\ncharge for options on foreign exchange and gold positions in accordance\nwith Part 6.2 (foreign exchange risk). For delta risk, the net delta-based\nequivalent of the foreign currency and gold options must be included in\nthe measurement of the exposure for the respective currency (or gold)\nposition.\n(3) The capital charge for an option on commodities must be based on the\ncharge calculated using the simplified approach in rule 6.4.6.\n6.3.9 Gamma capital charges\n(1) A banking business firm that writes options must calculate the capital\ncharge for gamma risk (gamma capital charge) for each option position\nseparately.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 269\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.3 Options risk\nRule 6.3.9\n(2) To calculate gamma capital charge, calculate the gamma impact of each\noption in accordance with the following formula:\n1\nGamma impact =  gamma VU 2\n2\nwhere:\nVU is:\n(a) for an interest rate option:\n(i) if the option has a bond as the underlying—the market value\nof the underlying multiplied by the risk factor applicable\nunder column 3 of table 6.6.8A; or\n(ii) if the option has an interest rate as the underlying—the\nmarket value of the underlying multiplied by the assumed\nchanges in yield in column 4 of table 6.6.8A;\n(b) for options on equities and stock indices—the market value of the\nunderlying multiplied by 8%;\n(c) for options on foreign exchange and gold—the market value of the\nunderlying multiplied by 8%; or\n(d) for an option on commodities—the market value of the underlying\nmultiplied by 15%.\n(3) In calculating the gamma impact for an option mentioned in the\ndefinition of VU, the firm must treat as the same underlying:\n(a) for interest rates—each time band in column 2 of table 6.6.8A\n(with each position allocated to separate maturity ladders);\n(b) for equities and stock indices—each recognised exchange;\n(c) for foreign currencies and gold—each currency pair and gold; and\n(d) for commodities—each individual commodity of a kind described\nin rule 6.4.2 (3) (a) or (b).\n(4) Each option on the same underlying described in subrules (2) and (3)\nwill have a gamma impact that is positive or negative. The firm must\nadd the individual gamma impacts, resulting in a net gamma impact for\neach underlying that is either positive or negative.\n(5) To calculate the firm’s total gamma capital charge, exclude gamma\nimpacts that are positive. The total gamma capital charge is the sum of\nthe absolute values of the net negative gamma impacts.\npage 270 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nOptions risk Part 6.3\nRule 6.3.10\n6.3.10 Vega capital charges\n(1) A banking business firm that writes options must calculate the capital\ncharge for vega risk (vega capital charge) for each option position\nseparately.\n(2) To calculate vega capital charge, the firm must multiply the vega for\neach option mentioned in the definition of VU in rule 6.3.9 (2) by a 25%\nproportional shift in the option’s current volatility. The results must then\nbe summed across each underlying.\n(3) The total vega capital charge is the sum of the absolute values of the\nvega capital charges across each underlying.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 271\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.4 Commodities risk\nRule 6.4.1\nPart 6.4 Commodities risk\n6.4.1 Relation to market risk\n(1) In measuring its market risk, a banking business firm must include the\nrisk of holding or taking positions in commodities and commodities\noptions (commodities risk).\nGuidance\n1 If a banking business firm is exposed to foreign exchange or interest rate risk\nfrom funding commodities positions, the firm must include the relevant positions\nin the measurement of interest rate or foreign exchange risk—see rules 6.2.2 (5)\nand 6.6.2 (4), respectively.\n2 Gold is not treated as a commodity (see the definition of commodity in the\nGlossary). Gold is dealt with as a foreign exchange position (rather than as a\ncommodity position) because the volatility of its prices is similar to that of a\ncurrency.\n(3) If a commodity is to be received or delivered under a forward contract,\nthe firm must report any foreign currency, equity or interest rate\nexposure from the other leg of the contract in accordance with Part 6.2,\nPart 6.5 or Part 6.6, respectively.\n6.4.2 Measuring commodities risk\n(1) A banking business firm must use the simplified approach to measure\ncommodities risk.\n(2) To calculate open positions using this approach, the firm may report\nshort and long positions in each commodity on a net basis. Positions are\nreported on a net basis by offsetting them against each other in\naccordance with subrule (3).\n(3) Positions in the same commodity may be offset. Positions in different\ncommodities must not be offset unless:\n(a) the commodities are deliverable against each other; or\n(b) the commodities are close substitutes for each other and a\nminimum correlation between price movements of 0.9 can be\nclearly established over at least the preceding year.\nA banking business firm must not use the correlation-based offsetting\nmentioned in paragraph (b) unless the Regulatory Authority has, in\nwriting, allowed the firm to use it.\n6.4.3 Measuring net positions\nA banking business firm must first state each commodity position (spot\nplus forward) in terms of the standard unit of measurement for the\ncommodity (such as barrels, kilos or grams). The firm must then convert\npage 272 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nCommodities risk Part 6.4\nRule 6.4.4\nthe net position in each commodity into Qatari riyals at the current spot\nmarket exchange rates.\n6.4.4 What to include in commodities risk\n(1) In calculating the capital charge for commodities risk, a banking\nbusiness firm must include commodity derivatives and off-balance-\nsheet positions that are affected by changes in commodity prices (such\nas commodity futures and commodity swaps).\n(2) Options on commodities for which the options risk is measured using\nthe delta-plus method must also be included (with their underlying\nassets). Options for which the options risk is measured using the\nsimplified approach must be excluded.\n(3) The firm must convert commodity derivatives into notional\ncommodities positions and assign them to maturities under rule 6.4.5.\n6.4.5 Assigning notional positions to maturities\nFutures and forward contracts relating to a particular commodity must\nbe included in the measurement of commodities risk as notional\namounts in terms of the standard unit of measurement multiplied by the\nspot price of the commodity.\n6.4.6 Capital charges—simplified approach\n(1) The capital charge for commodities risk of a banking business firm is\nthe sum of:\n(a) 15% of the firm’s overall net position, long or short, in each\ncommodity; and\n(b) 3% of the firm’s gross position in each commodity.\n(2) Gross position, of a firm in a commodity, is the sum of the absolute\nvalues of all short positions and all long positions of the firm, regardless\nof maturity.\n(3) The firm must use the current spot price to calculate its gross position\nin commodity derivatives.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 273\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.5 Traded equity position risk\nRule 6.5.1\nPart 6.5 Traded equity position risk\n6.5.1 Relation to market risk\n(1) In measuring its market risk, a banking business firm must include the\nrisk of holding or taking positions in equities (equity position risk).\nNote For the treatment of options with equities as the underlying—see\nrule 6.3.8 (1). Under that rule, this Part on traded equity position risk applies\nto the option, but the capital charge must be based on the delta-weighted\npositions included in the measurement of specific and general risks.\n(2) If equities are to be received or delivered under a forward contract, the\nfirm must report any foreign currency or interest rate exposure from the\nother leg of the contract in accordance with Part 6.2 or Part 6.6,\nrespectively.\nGuidance\nIf a banking business firm is exposed to interest rate risk on equity positions, the firm\nmust include the relevant interest rate positions in the calculation of interest rate risk—\nsee rule 6.6.2 (4).\n6.5.2 Measuring equity position risk\n(1) The measurement of equity position risk in the trading book applies to\nshort and long positions in all instruments that exhibit market behaviour\nsimilar to equities.\nExamples of instruments with equity-like behaviour\n• common shares (whether voting or non-voting)\n• convertible securities and commitments to buy or sell equity securities\n• convertible bonds that trade like equities.\n(2) A banking business firm may report short and long positions in\ninstruments relating to the same issuer on a net basis.\n(3) The firm must calculate the long or short position in the equity market\non a market-by-market basis. That is, the firm must make a separate\ncapital calculation for each exchange in which it holds equities (whether\nor not a recognised exchange).\n6.5.3 What to include in equity position risk\n(1) In calculating the capital charge for equity position risk, a banking\nbusiness firm must include equity derivatives and off-balance-sheet\npositions that are affected by changes in equity prices (such as futures\nand swaps on individual equities and stock indices).\npage 274 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nTraded equity position risk Part 6.5\nRule 6.5.4\n(2) To calculate the charges for equity position risk for equity derivatives\nand other off-balance-sheet positions, the firm must convert positions\ninto notional equity positions, such that:\n(a) equity derivatives and off-balance-sheet positions relating to\nindividual equities are reported at current market prices;\n(b) equity derivatives and off-balance-sheet positions relating to stock\nindices are reported as the mark-to-market value of the notional\nunderlying equity portfolio; and\n(c) equity swaps are treated as 2 notional positions.\n6.5.4 Charges for specific and general risks\n(1) The capital charge for equity position risk consists of 2 separately\ncalculated charges:\n(a) a charge for the specific risk of holding a long or short position in\nan individual equity; and\n(b) a charge for the general risk of holding a long or short position in\nthe market as a whole.\n(2) The capital charge for specific risk is 8% of the gross position of a\nbanking business firm in equities listed on a recognised exchange and\n12% of the gross position of the firm in other equities. Gross position,\nof a firm in an equity market, is the sum of the absolute values of all\nshort equity positions and all long equity positions of the firm.\n(3) The capital charge for general risk is 8% of the net position of a banking\nbusiness firm. Net position, of a firm in an equity market, is the\ndifference between long equity positions and short equity positions of\nthe firm.\n(4) Equity position is the net of short and long exposures to an individual\ncompany. It is measured on the gross position across the company\n(rather than individual transactions).\n6.5.5 Offsetting positions\n(1) If a banking business firm takes a position in depository receipts against\nan opposite position in the underlying equity (whether or not listed in\nthe same country where the receipts were issued), it may offset the\npositions only if any costs on conversion are taken into account in full.\n(2) The firm may offset matched positions in an identical equity or stock\nindex in each market, resulting in a single net long or short position to\nwhich the specific and general risk capital charges are to be applied. For\nthis purpose, a future in an equity may be offset against an opposite\nphysical position in the same equity.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 275\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.5 Traded equity position risk\nRule 6.5.6\n6.5.6 Charges for index contracts\n(1) For an index contract on an index that a banking business firm considers\ndiversified, the firm must apply a general risk capital charge of 8%, and\na specific risk capital charge of 2%, to the net long or short position in\nthe contract.\n(2) For any other index contract, the firm must apply a general risk capital\ncharge of 8%, and a specific risk capital charge of 4%, to the net long\nor short position in the contract.\n(3) If required to do so by the Regulatory Authority, the firm must\ndemonstrate why the firm considers an index a diversified index.\nGuidance\nA banking business firm should test diversification against the following criteria used\nby the European Banking Authority:\n• The index must have a minimum number of equities. There must be an\nabsolute threshold below which the index cannot be considered sufficiently\ndiversified to ignore the specific risk completely.\n• None of the equities must significantly influence the volatility of the index.\nEquities must not represent more than a certain percentage of the total\nindex value.\n• The index must have equities diversified from a geographical perspective.\n• The index must represent equities that are diversified from an economic\nperspective. Different ‘industries’ must be represented in the index.\n6.5.7 Using arbitrage\n(1) If a banking business firm uses a futures-related arbitrage strategy under\nwhich the firm takes an opposite position in exactly the same index at\ndifferent dates or in different markets, the firm:\n(a) may apply the 2% specific risk capital charge in rule 6.5.6 (1) to\nonly 1 position; and\n(b) may exempt the opposite position from any capital charge for\nspecific and general risks.\n(2) The firm may also apply the 2% specific risk capital charge if:\n(a) the firm has opposite positions in contracts at the same date in 2\nsimilar indices; and\n(b) the Regulatory Authority has notified the firm in writing that the 2\nindices have sufficient common components to allow offsetting.\n(3) If the firm engages in an arbitrage strategy under which a futures\ncontract on a broadly-based index matches a basket of shares, the firm:\n(a) may decompose the index position into notional positions in each\nof the constituent stocks; and\npage 276 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nTraded equity position risk Part 6.5\nRule 6.5.8\n(b) may include the notional positions and the disaggregated physical\nbasket in the country portfolio, netting the physical positions\nagainst the index equivalent positions in each stock.\n(4) The firm may apply the 4% capital charge in subrule (5) to a position\nthat is part of the arbitrage strategy only if:\n(a) a minimum correlation of 0.9 between the basket of shares and the\nindex can be clearly established over at least the preceding year,\nand the firm has satisfied the Regulatory Authority that the method\nthe firm has chosen is accurate; or\n(b) the composition of the basket of shares represents at least 90% of\nthe index.\nNote To determine whether a basket of shares represents at least 90% of the\nindex—see rule 6.5.8.\n(5) If the values of the physical and futures positions are matched, the\ncapital charge is 4% (that is, 2% of the gross value of the positions on\neach side).\n(6) The firm must treat any excess value of the shares comprising the basket\nover the value of the futures contract, or excess value of the futures\ncontract over the value of the basket, as an open long or short position,\nand must use the approach for index contracts in rule 6.5.6 (1) or (2), as\nappropriate.\n(7) If an arbitrage does not satisfy the conditions in subrule (4), the firm\nmust treat the index position using the approach for index contracts in\nrule 6.5.6 (1) or (2), as appropriate.\n6.5.8 When basket of shares is 90% of index\n(1) To determine whether a basket of shares represents at least 90% of an\nindex, the relative weight of each stock in the basket must be compared\nto the weight of that stock in the index to calculate a percentage slippage\nfrom its weight in the index.\n(2) Stocks that are included in the index but are not held in the basket have\na slippage equal to their percentage weight in the index.\n(3) The sum of the slippages across all stocks in the index represents the\ntotal slippage from the index. The absolute values of the percentage\nslippages must be summed.\n(4) Deducting the total slippage from 100 gives the percentage coverage of\nthe index to be compared to the required minimum of 90%.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 277\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.6 Traded interest rate risk\nRule 6.6.1\nPart 6.6 Traded interest rate risk\nDivision 6.6.A General\n6.6.1 Relation to market risk\nIn measuring its market risk, a banking business firm must include the\nrisk of holding or taking positions in debt securities and other interest-\nrate-related instruments that are held in the trading book (interest rate\nrisk).\n6.6.2 What to include in interest rate risk\n(1) The measurement of interest rate risk in the trading book applies to all\nfixed-rate and floating-rate debt securities and other interest-rate-related\ninstruments that exhibit market behaviour similar to debt securities.\nExamples\n• non-convertible preference shares\n• convertible bonds that trade like debt securities.\n(2) A debt security that is the subject of a repurchase or securities lending\nagreement is taken to be owned by the lender of the security.\n(3) In calculating the capital charge for interest rate risk, a banking business\nfirm must include interest rate exposures arising from forward foreign\nexchange transactions and forward sales and purchases of commodities\nand equities.\nNote For forward contracts, see:\n• rule 6.2.1 (2) (foreign currencies)\n• rule 6.4.1 (3) ( commodities)\n• rule 6.5.1 (2) (equities).\n(4) The firm must also include any interest rate exposures arising from\nforeign exchange, equity and commodity positions.\n6.6.3 Capital charge—interest rate risk\nThe capital charge for interest rate risk consists of 2 separately\ncalculated charges:\n(a) a charge for the specific risk of holding a long or short position in\nan individual instrument; and\n(b) a charge for the general risk of holding a long or short position in\nthe market as a whole.\nNote 1 The capital charge for general risk is for the risk of loss arising from\nchanges in market interest rates.\nNote 2 To determine the capital charge for derivatives—see rule 6.6.12.\npage 278 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nTraded interest rate risk Part 6.6\nRule 6.6.4\nDivision 6.6.B Specific risk\n6.6.4 Calculating specific risk capital charge\n(1) The capital charge for specific risk arising from an on-balance-sheet or\noff-balance-sheet interest-rate position held in a banking business firm’s\ntrading book is calculated by multiplying the market value of the debt\nsecurity by the applicable charge set out in column 5 of table 6.6.4 for\nthe category and residual maturity of the instrument.\n(2) The firm may offset matched long and short positions (including\npositions in derivatives) in identical instruments with exactly the same\nissuer, coupon, currency and maturity.\nTable 6.6.4 Specific risk capital charges\ncolumn 1 column 2 column 3 column 4 column 5\nitem category external credit residual specific risk\nrating maturity capital\ncharge\n%\n1 government AAA to AA- 0.00\nA+ to BBB- 6 months or 0.25\nless\nmore than 6 1.00\nmonths and up\nto and\nincluding 24\nmonths\nmore than 24 1.60\nmonths\nBB+ to B- or 8.00\nunrated\nBelow B- 12.00\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 279\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.6 Traded interest rate risk\nRule 6.6.4\ncolumn 1 column 2 column 3 column 4 column 5\nitem category external credit residual specific risk\nrating maturity capital\ncharge\n%\n2 qualifying 6 months or 0.25\nless\nmore than 6 1.00\nmonths and up\nto and\nincluding 24\nmonths\nmore than 24 1.60\nmonths\n3 other BB+ to BB- or 8.00\nunrated\nBelow BB- 12.00\n(3) In column 2 of table 6.6.4:\ngovernment, as a category, includes all forms of government paper such\nas bonds, treasury bills and other short-term instruments.\nNote Financial instruments issued by the State of Qatar (whether denominated in\nQatari riyals or not), or by other member states of the GCC, are risk-\nweighted at zero per cent.\nqualifying, as a category, includes:\n(a) securities issued by public sector enterprises and multilateral\ndevelopment banks;\nNote For a list of multilateral development banks that qualify for 0% risk weight,\nsee rule 4.4.16 (1) and for the criteria that may be applied in determining\nwhether another multilateral development bank may qualify for 0% risk\nweight, see the guidance following rule 4.4.16 (2).\n(b) instruments rated investment grade by at least 2 ECRAs;\n(c) instruments rated investment grade by 1 ECRA and 1 other credit\nrating agency that is not an ECRA;

In that method,\npositions are allocated to a maturity ladder before the capital charge is\ncalculated.\n(2) The firm must add the absolute values of the individual net positions\nwithin each time band, whether long or short. The sum of the absolute\nvalues is the firm’s gross position.\n6.6.7 Maturity method\n(1) In the maturity method, long or short positions in debt securities (and in\nother sources of interest rate exposures such as derivative instruments)\nare allocated to the time bands in table 6.6.8A (and then to the zones in\ntable 6.6.8B) based on the residual maturity of the instrument and the\ninterest rate of coupon payments.\n(2) A banking business firm must allocate:\n(a) positions in fixed-rate instruments according to their residual term\nto maturity; and\n(b) positions in floating-rate instruments according to the residual\nterm to the next re-pricing date.\n(3) The firm may offset:\n(a) long and short positions (whether actual or notional) in identical\ninstruments with exactly the same issuer, coupon, currency and\nmaturity; and\n(b) matched swaps, forward contracts, futures and forward rate\nagreements that satisfy the criteria in rule 6.6.13.\n6.6.8 Steps in calculating general risk capital charge\nThe steps to calculate the general risk capital charge are:\nStep 1\nWeight the positions in each time band by the risk factor corresponding\nto those positions in table 6.6.8A.\npage 282 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nTraded interest rate risk Part 6.6\nRule 6.6.8\nTable 6.6.8A Time Bands and risk factors\ncolumn 1 column 2 column 3 column 4\nitem time band risk factor assumed\n% changes in yield\n%\n1 1 month or less 0.00 1.00\n2 more than 1 and up to 3 0.20 1.00\nmonths\n3 more than 3 and up to 6 0.40 1.00\nmonths\n4 more than 6 and up to 12 0.70 1.00\nmonths\n5 more than 1 and up to 2 1.25 0.90\nyears\n6 more than 2 and up to 3 1.75 0.80\nyears\n7 more than 3 and up to 4 2.25 0.75\nyears\n8 more than 4 and up to 5 2.75 0.75\nyears\n9 more than 5 and up to 7 3.25 0.70\nyears\n10 more than 7 and up to 10 3.75 0.65\nyears\n11 more than 10 and up to 15 4.50 0.60\nyears\n12 more than 15 years and up 5.25 0.60\nto 20 years\n13 more than 20 years 6.00 0.60\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 283\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.6 Traded interest rate risk\nRule 6.6.8\nStep 2\nOffset the weighted long and short positions within each time band.\nExample\nIf the sum of the weighted long positions in a time band is QR100 million and the sum\nof the weighted short positions in the band is QR90 million, you offset the positions\nto come up with a matched position of QR90 million and unmatched position of QR10\nmillion.\nStep 3\nFor each time band, apply a 10% capital charge (vertical disallowance)\non the matched position calculated in step 2.\nExample\nContinuing on from the example in step 2, apply the 10% on the QR90 million matched\nposition to come up with a QR9 million vertical disallowance for the time band.\nStep 4\nFor the unmatched positions calculated in step 2, carry out 2 further\nrounds of offsetting using the zones (made up of time bands) in\ntable 6.6.8B and apply the appropriate capital charge, as follows:\n(a) first between the remaining unmatched positions within each of 3\nzones and subject to a charge (expressed as a percentage) as\nfollows:\n(i) matched weighted positions within zone 1 x 40%;\n(ii) matched weighted positions within zone 2 x 30%;\n(iii) matched weighted positions within zone 3 x 30%;\n(b) subsequently between the remaining unmatched positions across\nthe three different zones (in the order set out below) and subject to\na capital charge as follows:\n(i) matched weighted positions between zones 1 and 2 x 40%;\n(ii) matched weighted positions between zones 2 and 3 x 40%;\n(iii) matched weighted positions between zones 1 and 3 x 100%.\nThe absolute value of the net amount remaining is the net position.\nTable 6.6.8B Zones for coupons\ncolumn 1 column 2 column 3\nitem zone time bands\n1 zone 1 0 – 1 month\n1 – 3 months\n3 – 6 months\n6 – 12 months\npage 284 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nTraded interest rate risk Part 6.6\nRule 6.6.9\ncolumn 1 column 2 column 3\nitem zone time bands\n2 zone 2 1 – 2 years\n2 – 3 years\n3 – 4 years\n3 zone 3 4 – 5 years\n5 – 7 years\n7 – 10 years\n10 – 15 years\n15 – 20 years\nmore than 20 years\nStep 5\nCalculate the horizontal allowance by adding the charges from\nparagraphs (a) and (b) of step 4.\nStep 6\nCalculate the general risk capital charge as the sum of:\n(a) the net position calculated from steps 1 to 4;\n(b) the vertical disallowance from step 3;\n(c) the horizontal disallowance from steps 4 and 5; and\n(d) the net charge for positions in options, where appropriate,\ncalculated in accordance with Part 6.3.\n6.6.9 Positions in currencies\n(1) A banking business firm must use separate maturity ladders for\npositions in each currency, with capital charges calculated separately for\neach currency and then summed. Positions in different currencies are\nnot to be offset.\n(2) If the firm’s position in a currency is less than 5% of the value of the\nfirm’s banking book assets, that currency is taken to be a residual\ncurrency and the firm may use a single maturity ladder for all residual\ncurrencies (instead of having to use separate maturity ladders for each\ncurrency). The firm must enter, into each appropriate time band, the net\nlong or short position for residual currencies.\n(3) The firm must apply, with no further offsets, the risk factor in column 3\nof table 6.6.8A to the position in each time band for residual currencies.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 285\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.6 Traded interest rate risk\nRule 6.6.10\n6.6.10 Futures and forward contracts\n(1) A banking business firm must treat futures and forward contracts on\nbank or corporate debt (including forward rate agreements) as a\ncombination of a long and a short position in the underlying debt\nsecurity. Futures and forward contracts not on bank or corporate debt\nmust be treated as a combination of a long and a short position in a\nnotional government security.\n(2) The maturity of a futures contract or a forward rate agreement is the\nperiod until delivery or exercise of the contract, plus the life of the\nunderlying (or notional underlying) instrument. The firm must report\nthe long and short positions at the market value of the underlying (or\nnotional underlying) security or portfolio of securities.\n(3) If a range of instruments may be delivered to fulfil a contract, the firm\nmay choose the deliverable security to be allocated to the maturity\nladder. The firm must, however, take account of any conversion factor\nspecified by the exchange where the instrument must be delivered.\n6.6.11 Swaps\n(1) A banking business firm must treat a swap as 2 notional positions in\ngovernment securities with maturities. Both legs of the swap must be\nreported at their market values.\n(2) For swaps that pay or receive a fixed or floating interest rate against\nsome other reference price (for example, a stock index), the firm must:\n(a) enter the interest rate component into the appropriate maturity\ncategory; and\n(b) include any equity component in the measurement of equity risk.\n(3) Each leg of a cross-currency swap must be reported in the maturity\nladder for the currency concerned. The capital charge for any foreign\nexchange risk arising from the swaps must be calculated in accordance\nwith rules 6.2.2 to 6.2.6.\n6.6.12 Derivatives\n(1) In the measurement of interest rate risk, a banking business firm must\ninclude interest rate derivatives and off-balance-sheet instruments in the\ntrading book if those instruments react to changes in interest rates.\n(2) The firm must convert derivatives into positions in the relevant\nunderlying to enable the firm to calculate specific and general risk\ncapital charges. To determine the capital charges, the value of the\npositions must be the market value of the underlying or notional\nunderlying.\npage 286 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nTraded interest rate risk Part 6.6\nRule 6.6.13\n(3) Positions in derivatives are subject to charges for general risk in the\nsame way as cash positions.

However, the firm need not collect data on any operational\nrisk event for which the gross amount of loss is less than QR 40,000.\n(2) In this Chapter, the set of data resulting from that collection is called the\nfirm’s operational loss dataset.\n(3) The procedures and processes:\n(a) must be subject to validation before the dataset is used to calculate\nthe firm’s operational risk capital requirement; and\n(b) must be regularly independently reviewed by the firm’s internal or\nexternal audit functions.\n(4) The procedures and processes must provide for the collection of at least\nthe following information for an operational risk event:\n(a) the gross amount of the resulting loss (the gross loss);\n(b) if available, the date when the event happened or began (date of\noccurrence);\n(c) the date when the firm became aware of the event (date of\ndiscovery);\n(d) the date (or dates) when the event resulted in a loss, reserve or\nprovision against a loss being recognised in the firm’s profit and\nloss accounts (date of accounting);\n(e) any recovery of the gross loss;\n(f) descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the event.\n(5) The level of detail of the information the firm collects about an event\nmust be proportionate to the gross loss amount resulting from the event.\n(6) When building the dataset, the firm must use the date of accounting as\nthe date of a loss (except that, in the case of a legal loss event (that is, a\nlegal event that results in a loss), the bank must use a date no later than\nthe date of accounting).\n(7) If 2 or more losses:\n(a) had the same operational risk event in common as a cause; or\n(b) were caused by related operational risk events over time, but were\nposted to the accounts over several years;\npage 290 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nCollection and reporting of operational loss data Part 7.3\nRule 7.3.2\nthe losses must be allocated to the corresponding years of the loss\ndatabase, in line with their accounting treatment.\n(8) Data on losses that result from mergers or acquisitions must be included\nin the dataset.\n(9) The following are not to be included in the dataset:\n(a) costs of general maintenance on property, plant or equipment;\n(b) internal or external expenditure to enhance the firm’s business\nafter operational risk losses (such as upgrades, improvements, risk\nassessment initiatives and enhancements);\n(c) insurance premiums.\n7.3.2 Meaning of gross loss, recovery and net loss for\noperational risk events\n(1) The gross loss for an operational risk event is the loss resulting from the\nevent before any kind of recovery. Gross loss from such an event\nincludes:\n(a) any direct charge (including any impairment or settlement) to the\nrelevant firm’s profit and loss accounts;\n(b) costs incurred as a result of the event, including expenses directly\nlinked to the event (such as legal expenses and fees paid to advisors\nor suppliers) and costs of repairs or replacements;\n(c) provisions or reserves accounted for in the profit and loss accounts\nagainst the loss;\n(d) losses temporarily booked in transitory or suspense accounts and\nnot yet reflected in the profit and loss accounts;\n(e) negative economic effects, booked in an accounting period,\nresulting from operational risk events affecting cash flows or\nfinancial statements in previous accounting periods.\n(2) A recovery for an operational risk event is an independent occurrence,\nrelated to the event, but separate in time, in which funds, or inflows of\neconomic benefits, are received from a third party.\nExamples\npayments received from insurers\nrepayments received from perpetrators of fraud\nrecoveries of misdirected transfers\n(3) The net loss for an operational risk event is the loss resulting from the\nevent after any recovery.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 291\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nPart 7.3 Collection and reporting of operational loss data\nRule 7.3.3\n7.3.3 Reporting to Regulatory Authority\nThe Regulatory Authority may, by notice given to a banking business\nfirm, require the firm to report internal loss data in the level 1 categories\nset out in Annex 9, Detailed loss event classification, to International\nConvergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A\nRevised Framework Comprehensive Version, published by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision in June 2006.\npage 292 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nOperational risk capital requirement Part 7.4\nRule 7.4.3\nPart 7.4 Operational risk capital\nrequirement\nDivision 7.4.B Standardised approach\n7.4.3 Commencement—Division 7.4.B\nThis Division commences on 1 January 2023.\n7.4.4 Standardised approach—calculation\n(1) A banking business firm must use the standardised approach to\noperational risk. Operational risk capital requirement is the amount of\ncapital that the firm must have to cover its operational risk.\n(2) The standardised approach is based on the following factors:\n(a) the business indicator (BI), which is a financial-statement-based\nproxy for operational risk;\n(b) the business indicator component (BIC), which is calculated by\nmultiplying the BI by a set of marginal coefficients;\n(c) the internal loss multiplier (ILM), which is a scaling factor that is\nbased on a firm’s average historical losses and the BIC.\n(3) The business indicator is the sum of:\n(a) the interest, leases and dividend component (ILDC);\n(b) the services component (SC): and\n(c) the financial component (FC);\nwhere ILDC, SC and FC are calculated as set out in rule 7.4.5.\n7.4.5 Calculation of ILDC, SC and FC\n(1) In a formula in this rule, a bar above a term means that the term is to be\ncalculated as the average of the relevant quantity over the current\naccounting year and the 2 previous accounting years of the firm\nconcerned.\n(2) The factors ILDC, SC and FC are calculated in accordance with the\nfollowing formulas:\n𝐼𝐿𝐷𝐶 = 𝑀𝑖𝑛 [𝐴̅̅𝑏̅̅𝑠̅ ̅(̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑡̅𝑒̅̅𝑟̅𝑒̅̅𝑠̅𝑡̅ ̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑐̅𝑜̅̅𝑚̅̅𝑒̅̅ –̅̅̅ 𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑡̅𝑒̅̅𝑟̅𝑒̅𝑠̅̅𝑡̅ ̅𝑒̅𝑥̅̅𝑝̅̅𝑒̅𝑛̅̅𝑠̅𝑒̅); 2.25% 𝐼̅̅𝑛̅𝑡̅̅𝑒̅𝑟̅̅𝑒̅𝑠̅𝑡̅̅ 𝑒̅̅𝑎̅̅𝑟̅𝑛̅̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑔̅ ̅𝑎̅̅𝑠̅𝑠̅̅𝑒̅𝑡̅𝑠̅]\n+̅ 𝑑̅̅𝑖̅𝑣̅̅𝑖𝑑̅̅𝑒̅̅𝑛̅𝑑̅̅ ̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑐̅𝑜̅̅𝑚̅̅𝑒̅\n𝑆𝐶 =𝑀𝑎𝑥 [𝑂̅̅̅𝑡̅ℎ̅𝑒̅̅𝑟̅̅ 𝑜̅̅𝑝̅̅𝑒̅𝑟̅̅𝑎̅𝑡̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑔̅̅ ̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑐̅𝑜̅̅𝑚̅̅𝑒̅;̅𝑜̅𝑡̅ℎ̅̅𝑒̅𝑟̅̅ ̅𝑜̅𝑝̅̅𝑒̅𝑟̅̅𝑎̅̅𝑡̅𝑖̅𝑛̅𝑔̅̅ ̅𝑒̅𝑥̅̅𝑝̅̅𝑒̅𝑛̅̅𝑠̅𝑒̅]\n+𝑀𝑎𝑥 [̅𝐹̅𝑒̅̅𝑒̅ ̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑐̅𝑜̅̅𝑚̅̅𝑒̅;̅𝑓̅𝑒̅̅𝑒̅ ̅𝑒̅𝑥̅̅𝑝̅̅𝑒̅𝑛̅̅𝑠̅𝑒̅]\n𝐹𝐶 =𝐴̅̅𝑏̅̅𝑠̅̅(̅𝑛̅̅𝑒̅𝑡̅ ̅𝑃̅̅&̅̅𝐿̅̅ 𝑡̅̅𝑟̅𝑎̅̅𝑑̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑔̅̅ ̅𝑏̅𝑜̅̅𝑜̅̅𝑘̅)̅+𝐴̅̅𝑏̅̅𝑠̅̅(̅𝑛̅̅𝑒̅𝑡̅ ̅𝑃̅̅&̅̅𝐿̅̅ 𝑏̅̅𝑎̅̅𝑛̅𝑘̅̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑔̅̅ 𝑏̅̅𝑜̅̅𝑜̅𝑘̅).\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 293\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nPart 7.4 Operational risk capital requirement\nRule 7.4.5\nGuidance—meaning of business indicator terms\nP&L or Description Typical sub-items\nbalance-\nsheet items\nInterest, lease and dividend component\nInterest Interest income from all • interest income from loans and\nincome financial assets and other advances, assets available for\ninterest income (includes sale, assets held to maturity,\ninterest income from trading assets, financial leases\nfinancial and operating and operational leases\nleases and profits from • interest income from hedge\nleased assets) accounting derivatives\n• other interest income\n• profits from leased assets\nInterest Interest expenses from • interest expenses from deposits,\nexpenses all financial liabilities and debt securities issued, financial\nother interest expenses leases, and operating leases\n(includes interest • interest expenses from hedge\nexpense from financial accounting derivatives\nand operating leases, • other interest expenses\nlosses, depreciation and • losses from leased assets\nimpairment of operating • depreciation and impairment of\nleased assets) operating leased assets\nInterest Total gross outstanding loans, advances, interest bearing\nearning securities (including government bonds), and lease assets\nassets measured at the end of each financial year\n(balance\nsheet item)\nDividend Dividend income from investments in stocks and funds not\nincome consolidated in the firm’s financial statements, including dividend\nincome from non-consolidated subsidiaries, associates and joint\nventures\nServices component\nFee and Income received from Fee and commission income from:\ncommission providing advice and • securities (issuance, origination,\nincome services.

For firms with a BI less than\nor equal to QR 4 bn, the BIC is equal to BI × 12%. For a BI of QR 165 bn, the BIC\nwould be (4 x 12%) + ((120 - 4) x 15%) + ((165 - 120) x 18%) = QR 25.98 bn.\n7.4.7 Calculation of internal loss multiplier\n(1) A banking business firm’s internal loss multiplier (ILM) is intended to\ntake into account the firm’s operational risk experience in calculating\nthe firm’s operational risk capital requirement.\n(2) The firm’s ILM is calculated by the formula:\n𝐿𝐶 0.8\n𝐼𝐿𝑀 = ln(exp(1)− 1+( ) )\n𝐵𝐼𝐶\nwhere LC (the loss component) is equal to 15 times the firm’s average\nannual losses incurred over the previous 10 years as a result of\noperational risk events.\nGuidance\nThe ILM is equal to 1 if the firm’s loss component and business indicator component\nare equal. If the LC is greater than the BIC, the ILM is greater than 1. That is, a firm\nwith losses that are high relative to its BIC is required to hold more capital.\nConversely, if the LC is lower than the BIC, the ILM is less than 1 and the firm is\nrequired to hold less capital.\n(3) If the firm holds 10 years of high-quality annual loss data, collected as\nset out in Part 7.3, the calculation of average losses for subrule (2) must\nbe based on that 10 years of data. If the firm does not have 10 years of\nhigh-quality annual loss data, but has 5 years of such data, it may use\nthe 5 years of data.\n7.4.8 Calculation of operational risk capital requirement\n(1) A banking business firm’s operational risk capital requirement is the\nproduct of the firm’s BIC and its ILM.\n(2) However:\n(a) if a banking business firm’s loss data does not meet the standards\nset out in Part 7.3 for the whole of the previous 5-year period, the\nfirm’s operational risk capital requirement is equal to its BIC; and\n(b) the Regulatory Authority may direct the firm to apply an ILM\ngreater than 1.\n7.4.9 Approval of exclusion of certain losses from dataset\nThe Regulatory Authority may approve the exclusion, by a banking\nbusiness firm, of an operational loss event, or a class of operational loss\nevents, from the firm’s operational loss dataset if the Authority is\npage 296 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nOperational risk capital requirement Part 7.4\nRule 7.4.10\nsatisfied that the event, or events of that class, are no longer relevant to\nthe firm’s risk profile.\nGuidance\nApproval to exclude internal loss events will be granted rarely and an application to\ndo so must be supported by strong justification. In evaluating the relevance of an\noperational loss event to the firm’s risk profile, the Authority will consider whether\nthe cause of the event could occur in other areas of the firm’s operations. Taking settled\nlegal exposures and divested activities as examples, the Authority will expect the firm\nto demonstrate that there is no similar or residual legal exposure and that the event to\nbe excluded has no relevance to other continuing activities or products.\nThe Authority would approve such an exclusion only if satisfied that the loss to be\nexcluded is material to the firm’s operations (for example, that the relevant loss is\ngreater than 5% of the firm’s average losses).\nThe Authority would approve the exclusion of a loss event (except for losses related\nto divested activities) only after it has been included in the firm’s operational loss\ndataset for a minimum period (for example, 3 years).\nDivision 7.4.C Additional powers of Regulatory\nAuthority\n7.4.10 Powers of Regulatory Authority in relation to operational\nrisk capital requirement\nDespite anything in Division 7.4.B, if the Regulatory Authority\nidentifies points of exposure or vulnerability to operational risk that are\ncommon to 2 or more banking business firms, it may impose specific\ncapital requirements or limits on each affected firm.\nExamples\n• outsourcing of important operations by many banking business firms to a single\nprovider\n• severe disruption to providers of payment and settlement services.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 297\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.1\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\n7A.1.1 Introduction\nThe leverage ratio is a simple, transparent, non-risk-based measure to\nhelp restrict the build-up of leverage in the banking system. Excessive\nleverage can expose banking businesses to higher financial risk, with\npotential damage to the overall financial system, and to the economy if\na de-leveraging process takes place.\n7A.1.2 Objectives of leverage ratio requirements\nThe leverage ratio supplements the risk-based capital requirements of\nthe rest of these Rules. The objectives of limiting banking business\nfirms’ leverage ratios are as follows:\n(a) to constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, to help\navoid destabilising deleveraging that can damage the broader\nfinancial system and the economy;\n(b) to reinforce the risk-based requirements in Chapter 3 with a simple,\nnon-risk-based backstop measure;\n(c) to serve as a broad measure of the sources of leverage, both on and\noff the balance-sheet.\n7A.1.3 How to calculate leverage ratio\nA banking business firm’s leverage ratio LR is calculated by means of\nthe following formula:\n𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑟 1 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙\nLR = × 100\n𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒\nwhere:\ntier 1 capital has the meaning given by rule 3.2.7 (2).\ntotal exposure measure is the total amount of all the firm’s exposures,\ncalculated in accordance with rule 7A.1.5.\n7A.1.4 Minimum leverage ratio\n(1) A banking business firm must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 3%.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority may direct a banking business firm to\nmaintain a leverage ratio higher than 3% if the Authority considers it\nnecessary to do so because of the firm’s risk profile or other particular\ncircumstances.\npage 298 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.5\n7A.1.5 How to calculate total exposure measure — general\n(1) A banking business firm’s total exposure measure is the sum of:\n(a) on-balance-sheet exposures (except on-balance-sheet derivatives\nexposures and SFT exposures) (see rule 7A.1.7);\n(b) its derivatives exposures (see rules 7A.1.11 to 7A.1.17);\n(c) its SFT exposures (see rules 7A.1.18 and 7A.1.19); and\n(d) its off-balance-sheet exposures (see rule 7A.1.20).\nGuidance\nSFT exposures are exposures from securities financing transactions such as\nrepurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and\nborrowing, and margin lending contracts, where the value of the contracts depends on\nthe market valuation of securities and the contracts are typically subject to margin\nagreements.\n(2) When a banking business firm is calculating its total exposure measure,\nit must follow the accounting standard that the firm normally uses,\nexcept that:\n(a) on-balance-sheet, non-derivatives exposures must be included net\nof specific provisions or accounting valuation adjustments;\n(b) except as specified otherwise in this Part, the firm must not take\naccount of physical or financial collateral, guarantees or other\ncredit risk mitigation techniques; and\n(c) loans and deposits must not be netted.\nNote For the permitted accounting standards, see rule 2.1.6.\n7A.1.6 Modification of calculation\n(1) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice, modify the\ncalculation of a banking business firm’s total exposure measure by, for\nexample:\n(a) allowing the firm not to take account of a particular exposure or\nclass of exposures;\n(b) directing the firm to apply a different risk-weight to an exposure\nor class of exposures;\n(c) directing the firm to take account of an exposure or class of\nexposures that would not otherwise be taken account of.\n(2) The Authority may give a notice under subrule (1) on the application of\nthe firm or on the Authority’s own initiative.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 299\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.7\n7A.1.7 How to calculate on-balance-sheet exposures\n(1) When a banking business firm calculates its total exposure measure, it\nmust include all on-balance-sheet items on the assets side of its balance-\nsheet, including the collateral of derivatives contracts and securities\nfinancing contracts.\n(2) On-balance-sheet non-derivative assets must be measured using their\nbalance-sheet (that is, unweighted) values less deductions for associated\nprovisions.\n(3) If the firm holds an asset in a fiduciary capacity, it may exclude the asset\nif the asset meets the accounting criteria for de-recognition and, if\napplicable, the accounting criteria for deconsolidation.\n(4) Items that are deducted completely from the firm’s tier 1 capital (such\nas goodwill) must also be deducted from its total exposure measure.\n(5) The amount of an investment in the capital of an unconsolidated\nfinancial entity that is wholly or partly deducted from the firm’s CET 1\nor additional tier 1 capital under the corresponding deduction approach\n(set out in Subdivision 3.2.D.3) or the threshold deduction approach (set\nout in Subdivision 3.2.D.4) must be deducted from the firm’s total\nexposure measure. An unconsolidated financial entity is a financial\nentity (that is, an entity involved in banking or other financial activity,\nor insurance) that is not included in the firm’s consolidated returns.\n(6) Liability items must not be deducted from the firm’s total exposure\nmeasure.\n7A.1.8 Effect of trade-date accounting\n(1) In calculating its on-balance-sheet exposures, a banking business firm\nthat uses trade-date accounting must reverse out any offsetting that is\nrecognised under the applicable accounting standard between cash\nreceivables for unsettled sales and cash payables for unsettled\npurchases.\n(2) The firm may offset between those receivables and payables (regardless\nof whether the offsetting is recognised under the applicable accounting\nstandard) if the following conditions are met:\n(a) the assets bought and sold that are associated with the payables and\nreceivables are fair valued through income and are included in the\nfirm’s trading book;\n(b) the contracts are settled on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP)\nbasis.\npage 300 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.9\n7A.1.9 Effect of settlement-date accounting\nA banking business firm that uses settlement-date accounting must\ncalculate its on-balance-sheet exposures as set out in rule 7A.1.7.\n7A.1.10 Treatment of cash pooling arrangements\n(1) For the purpose of calculating a banking business firm’s on-balance-\nsheet exposures, if the firm operates a cash pooling arrangement that\nentails a transfer at least daily of the balances of each participating\ncustomer’s account into a single balance, the customers’ account\nbalances are taken to be transformed into a single balance on the transfer\nif, after the transfer, the firm is not liable for the balances individually.\nGuidance\nThus, the basis of the leverage ratio exposure is the single account balance and not\nthose of the individual customer accounts.\n(2) If the transfer does not occur daily, a transformation into a single\naccount balance is taken to occur, and the single account balance may\nbe taken as the basis of the exposure measure, if all of the following\nconditions are met:\n(a) as well as providing for the individual customers’ accounts, the\narrangement provides for a single account into which of all the\nparticipating customers’ account balances can be transferred;\n(b) the firm:\n(i) has a legally enforceable right to transfer each participating\ncustomer’s account balance into a single account so that the\nbank is not liable for the balances individually, and\n(ii) at any time, the firm has the discretion and is able to do so;\n(c) the Regulatory Authority considers that the customers’ account\nbalances are transferred to a single account sufficiently often;\n(d) either:\n(i) there are no maturity mismatches among the customers’\naccounts; or\n(ii) all of those accounts are either overnight or on demand;\n(e) the firm pays interest and charges fees based on the combined\nbalance of the customers’ accounts that are covered by the\narrangement.\n(3) If the conditions in subrule (2) are not met, the firm’s leverage ratio\nexposure measure must be based on the individual balances of the\nparticipating customer accounts.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 301\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.11\n7A.1.11 Calculation of derivatives exposure — contracts covered by\neligible bilateral netting agreements\nFor derivative contracts covered by an eligible bilateral netting\nagreement, a banking business firm must calculate its derivatives\nexposure as set out in rules 4.6A.12 and 4.6A.13.\nNote In relation to how eligible netting agreements are to be applied for the\npurposes of this Division, see Subdivision 4.5.E.1.\n7A.1.12 Calculation of derivatives exposure — single derivative\ncontracts not covered by eligible bilateral netting\nagreement\nA banking business firm must calculate its exposure for a single\nderivative transaction that is not covered by an eligible bilateral netting\nagreement as the credit equivalent amount of the transaction, as set out\nin rule 4.6A.9 (2).\n7A.1.13 Cross-product netting not permitted\nCross-product netting (that is, netting between derivatives and securities\nfinancing contracts) is not permitted. If a banking business firm is a\nparty to a cross-product netting agreement that otherwise meets the\ncriteria for an eligible bilateral netting agreement, the firm may perform\nnetting separately in each product category if all the other conditions for\nnetting in the category are met.\n7A.1.14 Treatment of written credit derivatives\n(1) The effective notional amount for a written credit derivative that is\nleveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the contract is\nobtained by adjusting the notional amount of the contract in accordance\nwith this rule, to reflect the true exposure that results from the leverage\nor enhancement.\n(2) The effective notional amount may be reduced in either or both of the\nfollowing ways:\n(a) by the negative change in fair value amount that has been\nincorporated into the calculation of tier 1 capital in relation to the\nderivative;\n(b) by the effective notional amount of an offsetting purchased credit\nderivative on the same reference entity, if the conditions set out in\nsubrule (3) are satisfied.\n(3) The conditions for subrule (2) (b) are the following:\n(a) the written and the offsetting derivatives refer to the same legal\nentity;\npage 302 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.15\n(b) the remaining maturity of the offsetting derivatives is equal to or\ngreater than the remaining maturity of the written derivatives;\n(c) for single-name credit derivatives:\n(i) the credit protection purchased is on a reference obligation\nthat ranks equally with, or is junior to, the reference\nobligation of the written derivatives; and\n(ii) a credit event on the senior reference asset would result in a\ncredit event on the subordinated reference asset;\n(d) for tranched products, the purchased protection is on a reference\nobligation with the same level of seniority;\n(e) if the firm purchases protection on a pool of reference names, the\nprotection is economically equivalent to buying protection\nseparately on each individual name in the pool, and the pool of\nreference entities and the level of subordination in both contracts\nare identical.\n(4) When the effective notional amount is included in the exposure as described\nin subrule (2), and a deduction of offsetting purchased credit derivatives\nis made (see subrule (2) (b)), the effective notional amount of the\noffsetting credit protection must also be reduced by any resulting\npositive change in the firm’s tier 1 capital.\n(5) When the effective notional amount is included in the exposure as described\nin subrule (2), but no deduction of offsetting purchased credit derivatives\nis made (see subrule (2) (b)):\n(a) if an eligible bilateral netting agreement applies, the firm may\ndeduct the individual PFE add-on amount from PFE ; or\ngross\n(b) if no such netting agreement applies, the firm may set PFE for\nrule 7A.1.12 to 0.\n(6) However, no adjustments may be made to NGR.\n7A.1.15 Treatment of collateral\n(1) When a banking business firm is calculating its derivatives exposures,\nthe firm must not deduct collateral that it has received from\ncounterparties.\n(2) The firm must gross up its exposures by the amount of any collateral\nprovided by the firm if the provision of the collateral has reduced the\nvalue of the firm’s balance-sheet assets under the relevant accounting\nstandard.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 303\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.16\n7A.1.16 Treatment of cash variation margin\n(1) If all of the following conditions are met, a banking business firm may\ntreat the cash portion of variation margin exchanged between\ncounterparties as a form of pre-settlement payment:\n(a) either of the following is true:\n(i) the trades are cleared through a qualifying central\ncounterparty;\nNote For the meaning of qualifying central counterparty, see the\nGlossary.\n(ii) the cash received by the counterparty is not segregated;\n(b) the variation margin is calculated and exchanged every day, based\non mark-to-market valuation of derivatives positions;\n(c) the variation margin is received in the same currency as the\ncurrency of settlement of the relevant derivative contract;\n(d) the variation margin exchanged is the full amount that would be\nnecessary to fully extinguish the mark-to-market exposure of the\nderivative, subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts\napplicable to the counterparty;\n(e) derivative contracts and variation margins are covered by a single\nmaster netting agreement (MNA) between the counterparties;\n(f) the MNA explicitly stipulates that the counterparties agree to settle\nnet any payment obligations covered by it, taking into account any\nvariation margin received or provided if a credit event occurs\ninvolving either counterparty;\n(g) the MNA is legally enforceable and effective in all the relevant\njurisdictions, including in the event of default, bankruptcy or\ninsolvency.\n(2) If the conditions in subrule (1) are met, the firm may use the cash portion\nof the variation margin received to reduce the replacement cost portion\n(as set out in rule 4.6A.9 (2)) of the exposure, and may deduct the\nresulting receivables assets from the exposure, as follows:\n(a) if the firm receives cash variation margin from a counterparty, it\nmay reduce only the replacement cost portion of the exposure\namount of the derivatives asset by the amount of cash received if\nthe positive mark-to-market value of the derivatives contract or\ncontracts has not already been reduced by that amount;\n(b) if the firm provides cash variation margin to a counterparty, it may\ndeduct the resulting receivable from its exposure, if the cash\nvariation margin has been recognised as an asset.\npage 304 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.17\n7A.1.17 SFT exposures—firm acting as principal\n(1) When a banking business firm is acting as a principal in a securities\nfinancing contract, its total exposure measure must include the sum of:\n(a) its gross SFT assets as recognised for accounting purposes,\nadjusted in accordance with subrule (2); and\n(b) a measure of exposure to counterparty credit risk (CCR),\ncalculated in accordance with subrule (3).\n(2) The firm’s gross SFT assets as recognised for accounting purposes are\nadjusted as follows:\n(a) by excluding the value of any securities, received under a securities\nfinancing contract, that the firm has recognised as an asset on its\nbalance-sheet;\n(b) cash payables and cash receivables in securities financing\ncontracts with the same counterparty may be measured net if all\nthe following criteria are met:\n(i) the contracts have the same explicit final settlement date;\n(ii) the right to set off the amount owed to the counterparty\nagainst the amount owed by it is legally enforceable both\ncurrently in the normal course of business and in the event of\ndefault, insolvency or bankruptcy;\n(iii) either:\n(A) the firm and the counterparty intend to settle net or\nsettle simultaneously; or\n(B) the contracts are subject to a settlement mechanism that\nresults in the functional equivalent of net settlement\n(that is, the cash flows of the contracts are equivalent to\na single net amount on the settlement date).\nGuidance\nTo achieve that equivalence, both contracts are settled through the same\nsettlement system and the settlement arrangements are supported by cash\nor intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that settlement of both\ncontracts will occur by the end of the business day, and the linkages to\ncollateral flows do not result in the unwinding of net cash settlement. The\nfailure of any one contract in the settlement mechanism should delay\nsettlement of only the matching cash leg or create an obligation to the\nsettlement mechanism, supported by an associated credit facility.\n(3) The measure of exposure to CCR is calculated as follows:\n(a) for exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement,\nthe current exposure is:\nmax {(∑E - ∑C), 0};\ni i\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 305\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.17\nwhere:\n∑E is the total fair value of securities and cash lent to the\ni\ncounterparty for all contracts covered by the agreement.\n∑C is the total fair value of cash and securities received from the\ni\ncounterparty for those contracts;\n(b) if there is no qualifying master netting agreement, the current\nexposure for contracts with a counterparty must be calculated\ncontract by contract.\n(4) A bilateral netting agreement is a qualifying master netting agreement\nfor subrule (3) (a) only if:\n(a) it is legally enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction on an event of\ndefault, regardless of whether the counterparty is insolvent or\nbankrupt;\n(b) it provides the non-defaulting party with the right to terminate and\nclose out, in a timely way, all contracts under the agreement on an\nevent of default, including the insolvency or bankruptcy of the\ncounterparty;\n(c) it provides for the netting of gains and losses on contracts\n(including the value of any collateral) terminated and closed out\nunder it so that a single net amount is owed by one party to the\nother; and\n(d) it allows for the prompt monetisation or setoff of collateral on an\nevent of default.\n(5) Positions held in the firm’s banking book may be netted against\npositions held in its trading book only if both of the following conditions\nare satisfied:\n(a) all the contracts are marked to market daily;\n(b) any collateral is recognised as eligible collateral in the banking\nbook.\nNote For the meaning of eligible collateral, see the Glossary and\nrule 4.5.12.\n(6) For a securities financing contract that is treated, under the relevant\naccounting standard, as a sale, the firm must reverse all the sales-related\naccounting entries, and then calculate its exposure as if the contract had\nbeen treated as a financing contract under subrules (1) to (3) for the\npurposes of determining its SFT exposures.\npage 306 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.18\n7A.1.18 SFT exposures—firm acting as agent\n(1) If a banking business firm that is acting as an agent in a securities\nfinancing contract provides an indemnity or guarantee to a customer or\ncounterparty for any difference between the value of the security or cash\nthat the customer has lent and the value of the collateral that the\nborrower has provided, the firm must calculate its exposure in\naccordance with rule 7A.1.17 (3).\n(2) The firm may apply the treatment in subrule (1) only if:\n(a) the firm’s exposure to the contract is limited to the guaranteed\ndifference between the value of the security or cash that its\ncustomer has lent and the value of the collateral that the borrower\nhas provided; and\n(b) the firm does not own or control the underlying cash or security.\n(3) If the firm is exposed to the underlying security or cash in the contract\nto a greater extent than a guarantee for the difference, the firm must\ninclude, in the exposure, a further exposure equal to the full amount of\nthe security or cash.\nExample\nThe firm might be further exposed by managing collateral received in its own name or\non its own account rather than on the customer’s or borrower’s account, by on-lending\nor managing unsegregated collateral, cash or securities.\nNote When a banking business firm that is acting as agent in a securities financing\ncontract does not provide an indemnity or guarantee to any of the parties,\nthe firm has no exposure to the contract, and must set the relevant exposure\nto zero.\n7A.1.19 Other off-balance-sheet exposures\n(1) When a banking business firm calculates its total exposure measure, it\nmust include all off-balance-sheet items (for example, letters of credit,\nguarantees, commitments that are cancellable (either conditionally or\nunconditionally) and liquidity facilities).\n(2) If the firm is the sponsor or originator of a securitisation, securitised\nassets that are de-recognised from the firm’s balance-sheet are not to be\ntaken into account.\n(3) To calculate its other off-balance-sheet exposures, the firm must apply\nthe applicable credit conversion factor (CCF) set out in table 7A.1.19 to\nthe gross notional amount of the exposure.\n(4) For an undertaking to provide a commitment on an off-balance-sheet\nitem, the firm must apply the lower of the 2 applicable CCFs.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 307\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.19\nTable 7A.1.19 CCFs for other off-balance-sheet exposures\nItem Exposure CCF\n1 Commitments (other than securitisation 20%\nliquidity facilities) with an original maturity of\nup to 1 year\n2 Commitments (other than securitisation 50%\nliquidity facilities) with an original maturity of\nover 1 year\n3 Commitments that are unconditionally 10%\ncancellable at any time without notice, or that\neffectively provide for automatic cancellation if\nthe borrower’s creditworthiness deteriorates\n4 Direct credit substitutes (for example, general 100%\nguarantees of indebtedness (including standby\nletters of credit serving as financial guarantees\nfor loans and securities) and acceptances\n(including endorsements with the character of\nacceptances))\n5 Forward asset purchases, forward deposits and 100%\npartly-paid shares and securities that represent\ncommitments with certain drawdown\n6 Certain contract-related contingent items (for 50%\nexample, performance bonds, bid bonds,\nwarranties and standby letters of credit related\nto particular contracts)\n7 Note issuance facilities and revolving 50%\nunderwriting facilities\n8 Short-term (that is, maturity of less than 20 (for both\n12 months) self-liquidating trade letters of issuing and\ncredit arising from the movement of goods confirming\n(such as a documentary credit collateralised by firms)\nthe underlying shipment) that the firm has either\nissued or confirmed\n9 Off-balance-sheet securitisation exposures 100%\n(except an eligible liquidity facility or an\neligible servicer cash advance facility)\n10 Eligible liquidity facilities and eligible servicer 50%\ncash advance facilities\npage 308 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.19\nItem Exposure CCF\n11 Liquidity facilities and servicer cash advance 10%\nfacilities (if undrawn and able to be\nunconditionally cancelled without notice)\n(5) For items 9 and 10 in table 7A.1.19, an eligible liquidity facility or\neligible servicer cash advance facility is one that complies with all of\nthe following conditions:\n(a) the extent of the facility is expressly stated in a written agreement,\nand there is no explicit or implied recourse to the firm beyond the\nspecified contractual obligations;\n(b) the facility is provided on an arm’s-length basis, is subject to the\nfirm’s normal credit approval and review processes and is\ntransacted on market terms and conditions;\n(c) the facility is limited to a specified amount;\n(d) either the facility has a fixed termination date, or both of the\nfollowing are true:\n(i) the facility ends at the earlier of:\n(A) the scheduled maturity of the securitisation;

IRRBB is a major source of risk for firms\nthat conduct banking activities; this is particularly so if the firm’s\nbanking book assets is 15% or more of its total assets.\n(3) Interest rate risk in this Chapter refers to interest rate risk in the banking\nbook. Interest rate risk in the trading book is part of market risk in\nChapter 6.\n8.1.2 Interest rate risk in the banking book\n(1) Interest rate risk in the banking book or IRRBB is the risk to earnings\nor capital arising from movement of interest rates.\n(2) IRRBB arises from changing rate relationships among yield curves that\naffect bank activities (basis risk), from changing rate relationships\nacross the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk), and from interest-\nrate-related options embedded in bank products (option risk).\nExamples of sources of IRRBB\n• risks from underwriting on a firm-commitment basis\n• risks related to the mismatch of the re-pricing of assets and liabilities, and off-\nbalance-sheet short-term and long-term positions\n• risks arising from hedging exposure to an interest rate with exposure to another\nrate that re-prices under different conditions\n• risks related to uncertainties in the occurrence, timing, pricing or value of\ntransactions\n• risk that counterparties will redeem fixed-rate products when market rates\nchange.\n8.1.3 Requirement—interest rate risk in the banking book\nA banking business firm must hold sufficient capital to effectively\ncontrol or mitigate its IRRBB. The Regulatory Authority may impose a\ncapital requirement based on the firm’s ICAAP if the authority is of the\nview that the firm’s capital requirement is insufficient to cover its\nexposure to IRRBB.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 311\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Interest rate risk in the banking book\nRule 8.1.4\n8.1.4 Role of governing body—interest rate risk in the banking\nbook\n(1) A banking business firm’s governing body must ensure that the firm’s\nIRRBB management policy enables the firm to obtain a comprehensive\nfirm-wide view of its IBBRR, taking into account the nature, scale and\ncomplexity of its banking book activities.\n(2) The governing body must monitor:\n(a) the nature and level of IRRBB assumed by the firm;\n(b) the firm’s overall IRRBB profile; and\n(c) any changes in market conditions that may affect the firm’s current\nor prospective risk profile.\n(3) The governing body must ensure that the firm’s senior management\nestablishes and implements an IRRBB management policy that\nadequately identifies, measures, monitors, reports and controls or\nmitigates IRRBB.\nGuidance\n1 The governing body of the banking business firm may delegate its role in relation\nto IRRBB (but not its ultimate responsibility) to a committee of the governing\nbody.\n2 A banking business firm that conducts banking activities or complex principal\ndealing activities should create a committee to design and implement IRRBB\nmanagement. This committee may be the same as that described in guidance 1.\n8.1.5 Policies—management of interest rate risk in the banking\nbook\nA banking business firm’s IRRBB management policy must establish:\n(a) effective systems for the accurate and timely identification,\nmeasurement, evaluation, management and control or mitigation\nof IRRBB, and reporting to the firm’s governing body and senior\nmanagement;\n(b) regular review, and independent internal or external validation, of\nany model used by the firm to manage IRRBB (including review\nof significant assumptions);\n(c) prudent and appropriate limits that are consistent with the firm’s\nrisk appetite, risk profile and capital; and\n(d) procedures for tracking and reporting exceptions to, and deviations\nfrom, limits or policies.\nGuidance\n1 The Regulatory Authority expects a banking business firm to set quantitative and\nqualitative targets for IRRBB.\npage 312 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book Chapter 8\nRule 8.1.6\n2 For rule 8.1.5 (b), internal independent validation should be done by a function\nthat is independent of the function that assumed or incurred the risk.\n3 A firm’s IRRBB management policy should provide for the following:\n(a) the use of the output of the risk measurement under the policy to report the\nlevel of that risk to the senior management and governing body of the firm;\n(b) the measurement to be capable of measuring the risk using the earnings\napproach;\n(c) the measurement to be clearly defined and consistent with the nature and\ncomplexity of the structure of the firm’s balance sheet;\n(d) balancing cash flows as part of managing IRRBB;\n(e) approval by the governing body, or a committee of the governing body, of\nany major hedging or risk-management initiatives.\n4 The measurement of IRRBB should include all sources of the risk. The\nmeasurement should evaluate the effect of rate changes on earnings or economic\nvalue meaningfully and accurately.\n5 Depending on the size and complexity of its banking book, the firm may also\nneed to measure IRRBB using the economic value approach.\n6 Effective risk measurement:\n(a) should flag excessive exposures;\n(b) should evaluate all significant interest rate risk arising from the full range\nof a banking business firm’s assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet\npositions, across both trading and banking books;\n(c) should ensure that an integrated view of IRRBB across products and\nbusiness lines is available to management; and\n(d) should ensure accurate and timely data on all aspects of current positions.\n8.1.6 Assumptions and adjustments\n(1) A banking business firm must not use an assumption or adjustment\nrelating to the firm’s exposure to IRRBB unless the assumption or\nadjustment has been approved by its governing body, or a relevant\ncommittee of its governing body.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority may require a firm to seek the authority’s\napproval before using an assumption or adjustment.\n(3) If required to do so by the authority, the firm must demonstrate how the\nfirm used an assumption or adjustment (whether or not the authority\nrequired the assumption or adjustment to be approved).\n8.1.7 Floating-rate exposures\nA banking business firm must set a prudent limit on the extent to which\nfloating-rate exposures are funded by fixed-rate sources (and vice\nversa). In floating-rate lending, the firm must set a prudent limit to the\nextent to which it runs any basis risk that would arise if lending and\nfunding were not based on identical market interest rates.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 313\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Interest rate risk in the banking book\nRule 8.1.8\n8.1.8 New products and activities\nA banking business firm must identify the effect of IRRBB before it\nintroduces a new product or activity. The firm must consider managing\nthe effect through hedging (using swaps or other derivatives).\n8.1.9 Stress-testing and interest rate risk in the banking book\n(1) A banking business firm must carry out stress-testing of its exposures\nto IRRBB at intervals appropriate for the nature, scale and complexity\nof the firm’s business and for its risk profile. A firm with balance-sheet\npositions in 2 or more currencies must measure its risk exposure in each\ncurrency in which 5% or more of its banking book assets or banking\nbook liabilities is denominated.\n(2) The stress-testing:\n(a) must determine the re-pricing gap between the firm’s assets and\nliabilities, before and after the effect of derivative instruments is\ntaken into consideration; and\n(b) must determine the sensitivity of the firm’s net interest income to\na 200-basis-point change in interest rates in relation to the firm’s\nforecast banking book balance sheet.\n(3) For subrule (2) (b), the Regulatory Authority may, in writing, specify\nanother percentage or number of basis points.\nGuidance\nThe risk of changes in the capital values of instruments resulting from changes in\ninterest rates is taken to be market risk.\n(4) The firm must include appropriate scenarios in its stress-testing to\nmeasure the firm’s vulnerability to loss under adverse interest rate\nmovements.\n(5) The firm must report to the Regulatory Authority, in the form that the\nauthority directs, the results of its stress-testing.\n(6) In determining the effect of a rate change on its net interest income, the\nfirm must not assume that the rate will become negative.\nGuidance\nA banking business firm should measure its vulnerability to loss in stressed market\nconditions, including market conditions in which significant assumptions are no longer\nmet, and consider the results of that measurement when establishing and reviewing its\nIRRBB management policy. Stress scenarios for this exercise should include:\n(a) historical scenarios such as the Asian crisis in the late 1990s;\n(b) changes in the general level of interest rates (for example, changes in yields\nof 100 basis points or more in 1 year);\npage 314 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book Chapter 8\nRule 8.1.10\n(c) changes in the relationships between significant market rates (basis risk),\nsuch as:\n• a rapid increase in term deposit rates, savings deposit rates and\nbenchmark rates like LIBOR (but with no change in the prime\nrate); and\n• a drop in the prime rate (but with no change in term deposit rates,\nsavings deposit rates and benchmark rates);\n(d) changes in interest rates in separate time bands to different relative levels\n(that is, yield curve risk or changes in how interest rates vary over time);\n(e) changes in the liquidity of financial markets;\n(f) changes in the volatility of market rates; and\n(g) changes in business assumptions and parameters such as the correlation\nbetween 2 currencies.\n8.1.10 Duty to notify authority of decline in value\nA banking business firm must immediately notify the Regulatory\nAuthority if any stress-testing under this Chapter suggests that, as a\nresult of the change in interest rates described in rule 8.1.9 (2) (b), the\neconomic value of the firm would decline by more than 20%.\n8.1.11 Relation to internal capital adequacy assessment\nA banking business firm must be able to demonstrate to the Regulatory\nAuthority that its ICAAP adequately captures IRRBB.\nGuidance\nA banking business firm’s approach to evaluating and managing IRRBB as part of its\nICAAP should include the following:\n(a) the internal definition of, and the boundary between, banking book and\ntrading book;\n(b) a definition of economic value showing that it is consistent with the method\nused to value assets and liabilities;\n(c) the size and form of the different interest rate changes to be used for stress-\ntesting;\n(d) whether a dynamic or static approach is used to decide the effect of interest\nrate changes is used;\n(e) how to treat pipeline transactions (including any related hedging);\n(f) how to aggregate multi-currency interest rate exposures;\n(g) whether or not non-interest-bearing assets and liabilities, capital and\nreserves are included in the evaluation;\n(h) how to treat current and savings accounts (that is, the maturity attached to\nexposures without a contractual maturity);\n(i) how to treat fixed-rate assets or liabilities, if customers have a right to repay\nor withdraw early;\n(j) the extent to which sensitivities to small changes can be scaled up linearly\nwithout significant loss of accuracy (covering both convexity generally and\nthe nonlinearity of pay-off associated with explicit option products);\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 315\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Interest rate risk in the banking book\nRule 8.1.11\n(k) the degree of granularity employed (for example, offsets within a time band\nor zone);\n(l) whether all future cash flows or only principal balances are included.\npage 316 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity risk management—introductory Part 9.1\nRule 9.1.1\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.1 Liquidity risk management—\nintroductory\nDivision 9.1.A Preliminary\n9.1.1 Introduction—Chapter 9\n(1) This Chapter sets out a banking business firm’s obligations:\n(a) to adopt prudent practices in managing liquidity risk;\n(b) to maintain adequate liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall\ndue across a wide range of operating circumstances; and\n(c) to have adequate sources of stable long-term funding.\n(2) In general terms, this Chapter requires a banking business firm:\n(a) to have a risk management framework to measure, monitor and\nmanage liquidity risk that is appropriate for the nature, scale and\ncomplexity of the firm’s operations;\n(b) to maintain a portfolio of high-quality liquid assets sufficient to\nenable the firm to withstand a severe liquidity stress;\n(c) to maintain a robust funding structure appropriate for the nature,\nscale and complexity of the firm’s operations;\n(d) to limit maturity mismatches between its assets and its liabilities;\nand\n(e) to inform the Regulatory Authority promptly about liquidity\nconcerns.\n9.1.2 Categorisation of firms in terms of liquidity management\nobligations\n(1) For the purposes of this Chapter, banking business firms are either\nliquidity risk group A banking business firms or liquidity risk group B\nbanking business firms.\n(2) A banking business firm is a liquidity risk group A banking business\nfirm if it has been so designated by the Regulatory Authority.

This Part sets out:\n(a) what assets qualify as high-quality liquid assets;\n(b) how much the portfolio must be able to raise if monetised;\n(c) how assets must be valued for inclusion in the portfolio; and\n(d) how much of the portfolio’s value may be made up of assets of\ndifferent kinds.\nGuidance\nTo obtain liquidity, a firm could monetise an asset by, for example, sale or repo.\n(2) This Part also requires a banking business firm to maintain a specified\nratio (liquidity coverage ratio or LCR) of HQLA to its predicted need\nfor liquidity over a 30-calendar-day period.\n(3) The purpose of requiring banking business firms to maintain the HQLA\nportfolio, and to meet the LCR requirement, is to ensure that such firms\nare resilient, in the short term, to liquidity risk. The LCR requirement is\nintended to ensure that such a firm always holds unencumbered assets\nthat can be readily converted into sufficient cash to meet the firm’s\nliquidity needs for 30 calendar days even under severe liquidity stress.\n(4) A banking business firm is required to maintain its HQLA portfolio, and\nto meet the minimum LCR, at all times.

Any surplus of\nHQLA held at the firm may be treated as forming part of the parent\nentity’s HQLA portfolio only if those assets would be freely available\nto the parent entity during a period of liquidity stress.\n(2) When calculating its LCR on a consolidated basis, a cross-border\nbanking group must, subject to subrule (3), apply its home jurisdiction’s\nrules to all the legal entities that are being consolidated.\n(3) The firm must treat deposits by retail and small business customers with\na consolidated entity according to the rules in the jurisdiction in which\nthat entity operates. The firm must also apply those rules to decide\nwhether a particular deposit qualifies as a deposit by a retail customer\nor a small business customer.\n(4) A cross-border banking group must not take excess liquidity into\naccount in calculating its consolidated LCR if there is reasonable doubt\npage 330 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.6\nabout whether the liquidity would be available during a period of\nliquidity stress.\nGuidance\nLiquidity transfer restrictions (for example, ring-fencing measures, non-convertibility\nof local currency, and foreign exchange controls) in jurisdictions in which a banking\ngroup operates would affect the availability of liquidity by restricting the transfer of\nHQLA and funds flows within the group. The consolidated LCR should reflect the\nrestrictions consistently with this Part. For example, HQLA held to meet a local LCR\nrequirement by a subsidiary that is being consolidated can be included in the\nconsolidated LCR to the extent that the HQLA are used to cover the total net cash\noutflows of that subsidiary, even if the assets are subject to restrictions on transfer to\nthe parent entity. If the HQLA held in excess of the total net cash outflows are not\ntransferable, the firm should not count that surplus liquidity.\nDivision 9.3.B HQLA portfolio—makeup and value\n9.3.6 Requirement for HQLA portfolio—basic rules\n(1) A banking business firm must maintain an HQLA portfolio sufficient to\nmeet its funding needs for at least 30 calendar days under severe\nliquidity stress.\nNote The value of the HQLA portfolio must bear a minimum ratio to the firm’s\noutflows over the 30-calendar-day period. That minimum ratio is the\nliquidity coverage ratio or LCR—see rules 9.3.16 and 9.3.20.\n(2) The assets in the portfolio must be appropriately diversified in terms of\ntype, issuer, currency and counterparty.\n(3) The firm must be able to meet its liquidity needs in each currency in\nwhich it has significant exposure. The portfolio must be similar in\ncomposition (in terms of the currencies in which the assets are\ndenominated) to its liquidity needs.\n(4) For subrule (3), a banking business firm has significant exposure in a\ncurrency if 5% or more of the firm’s total liabilities are denominated in\nthe currency.\n9.3.7 HQLA portfolio—general operational requirements\n(1) A banking business firm’s HQLA portfolio must be under the control of\nthe specific function or functions charged with managing the firm’s\nliquidity. That function must always have the authority, and must\nalways be legally and operationally able, to monetise any asset in the\nportfolio.\nGuidance\nFor the firm to be operationally able to monetise assets, the firm must have the\nnecessary procedures and appropriate systems, and must have access to all the\nnecessary information. The function must actually be able to monetise any of the assets\nwithin the standard settlement period for the asset class.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 331\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.3 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.3.8\n(2) That control must be shown by:\n(a) maintaining the portfolio in a separate pool managed by the\nfunction solely as a source of contingent funds; or\n(b) showing that the function can monetise any asset in the portfolio\nat any time, and that the proceeds of doing so are available to the\nfunction throughout the following 30-calendar-day period,\nconsistently with the firm’s business and risk-management\nstrategies.\n(3) The firm must monetise a representative part of the portfolio\nperiodically (at least annually):\n(a) to test the firm’s access to the market, the effectiveness of its\nprocesses for liquidation and the availability of the assets; and\n(b) to minimise the risk of giving a negative signal during a period of\nactual liquidity stress.\n9.3.8 What assets are HQLA\n(1) An asset is HQLA if it falls within any of rules 9.3.10 to 9.3.12, or is\napproved by the Regulatory Authority as HQLA under rule 9.3.13.\nGuidance\nAssets that fall within any of rules 9.3.10 to 9.3.12 are HQLA because such assets can\nbe monetised easily and immediately with little or no loss of value.\n(2) A banking business firm must not include an asset in its HQLA portfolio\nif the asset is encumbered.\nNote For the meaning of encumbered, see rule 9.3.4 (2).\n(3) The firm must not include an asset in the portfolio if the firm could not,\nfor any operational, legal, regulatory or other reason, monetise it at any\ntime and receive the proceeds within 30 calendar days.\nGuidance\n1 For example, the firm should not include an asset if:\n• the asset was hypothecated to the firm and the asset’s beneficial owner has\nthe right to withdraw it\n• the sale of the asset without replacement would remove a hedge so as to\ncreate an open risk position in excess of the firm’s internal risk limit.\n2 When considering whether to include a particular asset, a firm should take into\naccount any possible delays in the settlement of a sale.\n3 Subrule (3) would not prevent assets received as collateral for derivatives\ntransactions from being included in the portfolio provided that:\n• the assets are not segregated and are legally able to be re-hypothecated\n• the firm records an appropriate outflow for the associated risks.\npage 332 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.9\n9.3.9 Classification of HQLA\n(1) HQLA are classified as either level 1 HQLA or level 2 HQLA.

calculating the total value of the portfolio and the percentages of its\nvalue made up of each category of HQLA, the value of an asset is taken\nto be its market value and is subject to the appropriate haircut set out in\nrule 9.3.15.\n(4) If an asset is involved in a transaction that matures within 30 calendar\ndays and involves the exchange of HQLA:\n(a) the transaction may be treated as having been unwound; and\n(b) the asset may be included in the portfolio.\n(5) Only assets held or owned by the firm on the day of calculation may be\nincluded in the calculation, regardless of their residual maturity.\n(6) If an asset in the firm’s portfolio that was formerly eligible as HQLA\nbecomes ineligible (for example, because of a rating downgrade), the\nfirm may continue to treat

subsequent calendar year—at 100% or higher.\nNote Rule 9.3.18 allows a banking business firm to monetise part of its HQLA\nportfolio during a period of liquidity stress.\nGuidance\nRule 9.3.16 sets minimum levels and is not intended to limit the generality of the\nrequirements in rule 9.3.6.\n(2) The requirement for the firm to maintain the LCR required by\nsubrule (1) is called the firm’s LCR requirement.\nGuidance\nAn authorised firm must be continually aware of its LCR because of the requirements\nfor the firm to maintain its LCR, and to report to the Regulatory Authority if the LCR\nfalls below the firm’s LCR requirement. How often the firm needs to calculate its LCR\ndepends on the nature of the firm’s business. Some relevant factors would be:\n• how volatile the values of the firm’s assets and exposures are\n• how actively the firm trades.\nFor the requirement to report if the firm’s LCR falls below its LCR requirement, see\nrule 9.3.19.\n9.3.17 Adjustment of firms’ LCR by Regulatory Authority\nThe Regulatory Authority may, by written notice to a banking business\nfirm, do any 1 or more of the following:\n(a) change the firm’s LCR requirement;\n(b) change the method for calculating the LCR requirement, or the\nassumptions or parameters for the purposes of that calculation;\n(c) impose additional requirements based on the Authority’s\nassessment of the firm’s exposure to liquidity risk.\n9.3.18 Monetising HQLA during periods of liquidity stress\nDuring a period of liquidity stress, a banking business firm may\nmonetise part of its HQLA portfolio, and may use the cash so generated\nto cover cash outflows. It may allow its LCR to fall below the level\nrequired by rule 9.3.16 to the extent necessary to deal with cash outflows\nduring that period.\npage 338 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.19\n9.3.19 Obligation to notify Regulatory Authority if LCR\nrequirement not met\n(1) A banking business firm must notify the Regulatory Authority in writing\nimmediately (but within 3 business days) if the firm ceases to meet its\nLCR requirement (or becomes aware of circumstances that may result\nin its ceasing to meet that requirement).\n(2) In the notification the firm must clearly explain:\n(a) why it ceased to meet, or thinks it may cease to meet, the\nrequirement;\n(b) when it expects to again be able to meet the requirement; and\n(c) what it has done, and will do, to ensure that it meets the\nrequirement in future, or continues to meet it, as the case requires.\nGuidance\nA banking business firm that gives such a notification should discuss with the\nRegulatory Authority what further steps it should take to deal with the situation.\nSubdivision 9.3.C.2 Calculating LCR\n9.3.20 How to calculate LCR\n(1) A banking business firm’s LCR is calculated by means of the following\nformula:\n𝑉𝑃\n𝐿𝐶𝑅 = ×100\n𝑇𝐶30\nwhere:\nTC30 is the firm’s total net cash outflow over the next 30 calendar days\n(all outflows, or outflows in the relevant currency, as the case requires),\ncalculated in accordance with rule 9.3.21.\nVP is the total value of the assets in the firm’s HQLA portfolio,\ncalculated in accordance with rule 9.3.15.\nNote To calculate the value of the portfolio, the market value of an asset in the\nportfolio is taken to be the asset’s market value, subject to a haircut—see\nrule 9.3.15.\n(2) The firm must calculate its LCR both overall, and separately for each\nsignificant currency in which it has liabilities. A currency is significant\nfor the firm if the firm’s liabilities denominated in it amount to 5% or\nmore of the firm’s total liabilities.\nGuidance\nA banking business firm that is active in several currencies:\n• should maintain an HQLA portfolio consistent with the distribution of its\nliquidity needs by currency\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 339\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.3 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.3.21\n• should assess its aggregate foreign currency liquidity needs and determine an\nacceptable level of currency mismatches\n• should separately analyse its strategy for each significant currency, considering\npossible constraints during a period of liquidity stress.\n9.3.21 How to calculate total net cash outflow over next\n30 calendar days\n(1) On any day, a banking business firm’s total net cash outflow over the\nnext 30 calendar days is the difference between:\n(a) its total expected gross cash outflow over that 30-calendar-day\nperiod; and\n(b) the lesser of:\n(i) 75% of its total expected gross cash outflow over that period;\nand\n(ii) its total expected cash inflow over that period.\nGuidance\nSubrule (1) (b) ensures that, for the purposes of the calculation, the firm’s cash inflow\ncan never be greater than 75% of its total expected gross cash outflow.\n(2) For that calculation:\n(a) the firm’s total expected gross cash outflow is to be calculated in\naccordance with Subdivisions 9.3.C.3 to 9.3.C.5; and\n(b) the firm’s total expected cash inflow is to be calculated in\naccordance with Subdivisions 9.3.C.6 to 9.3.C.8.\nSubdivision 9.3.C.3 Calculating total expected gross cash\noutflows—general\n9.3.22 How to calculate total expected gross cash outflow\n(1) Total expected gross cash outflow over a period is calculated by:\n(a) first, multiplying the outstanding balance of each category of\nliability or off-balance-sheet commitment by the rate at which it is\nexpected to run off or be drawn down during the period; and\n(b) then, adding up the balances so calculated.\nNote Rules 9.3.23 to 9.3.41 specify runoff rates for many kinds of cash outflow\nand give interpretative provisions. Those rules are based on Basel III LCR.\nThe interpretive provisions provide only minimal explanation of the reasons\nwhy particular kinds of outflow receive the runoff rates specified.

However, any amount over the limit is to be treated as a less stable\ndeposit.\nGuidance\nFor example, if a depositor has a deposit of 150 that is covered by a deposit insurance\nscheme that has a limit of 100, so that the depositor would receive at least 100 from\nthe scheme if the firm were unable to pay, then 100 would be considered fully insured\nand treated as a stable deposit, and 50 would be treated as a less stable deposit.\nHowever, if the scheme covered only a percentage of the deposit amount (for example,\n90% of the deposit amount up to a limit of 100), the entire 150 deposit would be treated\nas a less stable deposit.\n(6) A deposit insurance scheme is effective if all of the following are true:\n(a) the scheme guarantees that it can make payouts promptly;\n(b) its coverage is clearly defined;\n(c) the provider has formal legal powers to fulfil the scheme’s\nmandate, and is operationally independent, transparent and\naccountable;\n(d) public awareness of the scheme is high.\n(7) The additional criteria (for a deposit insurance scheme) mentioned in\ntable 9.3.23 are the following:\n(a) the scheme is pre-funded by periodic levies on entities with insured\ndeposits;\n(b) the scheme has ready access to additional funding in the event of\na large call on its reserves (for example, an explicit and legally\nbinding guarantee from its government, or a standing authority to\nborrow from its government);\n(c) depositors have access to insured deposits quickly if the scheme is\ncalled on.\n(8) A deposit that does not fall within subrule (4) is a less stable deposit.\n(9) If the firm cannot readily identify a term deposit as stable, it must treat\nthe full amount of the deposit as less stable.\n(10) The firm may exclude, from total expected cash outflows, the cash\noutflow related to a term deposit with residual maturity, or a notice\nperiod for withdrawal, longer than 30 calendar days only if:\n(a) the depositor has no legal right to withdraw the deposit within a\n30-calendar-day period; or\n(b) early withdrawal would result in a significant penalty that is\nmaterially greater than the loss of interest.\n(11) However, if the practice of the firm is to allow depositors to withdraw\nsuch deposits within the 30-calendar-day period without applying the\npage 342 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.24\ncorresponding penalty, each such deposit must be treated in full as a\ndemand deposit unless the Regulatory Authority approves otherwise.\n9.3.24 Treatment of deposits with unusual features\nDespite anything in rule 9.3.23, the Regulatory Authority may direct\nthat a higher run-off rate must be applied to a deposit, or a class of\ndeposits, that falls within that rule but presents unusual features.\n9.3.25 Treatment of deposits not in Qatari riyals, and deposits by\nnon-residents of Qatar\n(1) This rule applies to:\n(a) deposits, by residents of Qatar, not denominated in Qatari riyals;\nand\n(b) deposits by non-residents of Qatar, regardless of the currency of\ndenomination.\n(2) The run-off rate for deposits to which this rule applies is the rate that the\nRegulatory Authority directs.\n9.3.26 Treatment of unsecured wholesale funding\n(1) The runoff rates for unsecured wholesale funding are as set out in table\n9.3.26.\n(2) In the case of a deposit that is pledged as security for a credit facility,\nthis rule is subject to rule 9.3.27.\n(3) Wholesale funding consists of liabilities and general obligations, raised\nfrom legal entities, of which any 1 or more of the following is true:\n(a) the funding is callable within 30 calendar days;\n(b) the funding has its earliest possible contractual maturity date\nwithin 30 calendar days (for example, a maturing term deposit or\nan unsecured debt security); or\n(c) the funding has an undetermined maturity.\nGuidance\nWholesale funding includes funding that the provider has the option of withdrawing\nwithin the 30-calendar-day period (but not funding that is callable by the funds\nprovider subject to a contractually defined and binding notice period longer than\n30 calendar days).\n(4) Unsecured wholesale funding is wholesale funding that is not\ncollateralised by legal rights to specifically designated assets.\nUnsecured wholesale funding does not include obligations related to\nderivative contracts.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 343\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.3 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.3.26\nTable 9.3.26 Unsecured wholesale funding—runoff rates\nItem Kind of funding Runoff\nrate (%)\n1 Demand and term deposits (with maturity\nof 30 calendar days or less) provided by\nsmall business customers:\n• stable deposits (see subrule (5)) 5\n• less stable deposits (see subrule (5)) 10\n2 Operational deposits (see subrules (6)–\n(11)):\n• any part covered by deposit insurance 5\n• otherwise 25\nUnsecured wholesale funding from 25\ncooperative banks in an institutional\nnetwork (qualifying deposits with the\ncentral institution) (see subrules (12)–(14))\n3 Unsecured wholesale funding provided by\nnon-financial corporates, and sovereigns,\ncentral banks, MDBs, and public sector\nenterprises (see subrule (15)):\n• if the entire amount is fully covered by 20\ndeposit insurance\n• otherwise 40\n4 Unsecured wholesale funding provided by 100\nother legal entity customers (see\nsubrules (16)–(19))\n(5) In table 9.3.26, stable deposit and less stable deposit have the same\nrespective meanings as in rule 9.3.23.\n(6) Operational deposits are deposits placed or left with the firm by a\ncustomer to facilitate the customer’s access to, and ability to use,\npayment and settlement systems and otherwise make payments for the\npage 344 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.26\npurposes of clearing, custody or cash management services that meet all\nof the following criteria:\n(a) the customer is reliant on the firm to perform the services as an\nindependent third party intermediary;\nGuidance\nThis condition would not be met if the firm is aware that the customer has\nadequate back-up arrangements.\n(b) the services are provided under a legally binding agreement;\n(c) the termination of the agreement is subject to:\n(i) a notice period of 30 calendar days or more; or\n(ii) significant costs (such as transaction costs, costs related to\ninformation technology, or early termination or legal costs)\nthat must be borne by the customer if the deposit is moved\nbefore the end of 30 calendar days.\nGuidance\n1 Clearing is a service that enables customers to transfer funds (or securities)\nindirectly through direct participants in domestic settlement systems to final\nrecipients. Such services are limited to the following activities:\n• transmission, reconciliation and confirmation of payment orders\n• daylight overdraft, overnight financing and maintenance of post-settlement\nbalances\n• determination of intra-day and final settlement positions.\n2 Custody is the provision of safekeeping, reporting and processing of assets, or\nthe facilitation of the operational and administrative elements of related activities\non behalf of customers in the process of their transacting and retaining financial\nassets. Such services are limited to the settlement of securities transactions, the\ntransfer of contractual payments, the processing of collateral, and the provision\nof custody-related cash management services.\n3 Custody also includes the receipt of dividends and other income and client\nsubscriptions and redemptions, and extends to asset and corporate trust servicing,\ntreasury, escrow, funds transfer, stock transfer and agency services, (including\npayment and settlement services, but not correspondent banking), and depository\nreceipts.\n4 Cash management is the provision of cash management and related services to\ncustomers—that is, services provided to a customer to manage its cash flows,\nassets and liabilities, and conduct financial transactions necessary to its\noperations. Such services are limited to payment remittance, collection and\naggregation of funds, payroll administration, and control over the disbursement\nof funds.\n5 Correspondent banking is an arrangement under which a bank holds deposits\nowned by other banks, and provides payment and other services to settle foreign\ncurrency transactions.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 345\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.3 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.3.26\n(7) The firm may treat a deposit as an operational deposit only if the deposit\nmeets all of the following requirements:\n(a) it is a by-product of the underlying services provided by the firm;\n(b) it is not offered by the firm in the wholesale market in the sole\ninterest of offering interest income;\n(c) it is held in a specifically-designated account;\n(d) it is priced so as not to give customers an economic incentive to\nleave excess funds in the account.\n(8) Excess balances that could be withdrawn without jeopardising those\nclearing, custody or cash management activities are not to be treated as\noperational deposits.\n(9) The firm must determine how to identify such excess balances. If the\nfirm is unable to identify how much of a deposit is an excess balance,\nthe firm must assume that the entire deposit is excess and therefore not\noperational.\nGuidance\nThe identification should be sufficiently granular to adequately assess the risk of\nwithdrawal in an idiosyncratic stress situation. The method should take into account\nrelevant factors such as the likelihood that wholesale customers have above-average\nbalances in advance of specific payment needs, and should consider appropriate\nindicators (for example, ratios of account balances to payment or settlement volumes\nor to assets under custody) to identify customers that are not actively managing\naccount balances efficiently.\n(10) A deposit that arises out of correspondent banking, or from the provision\nof prime brokerage services, is not to be treated as an operational\ndeposit.\nGuidance\nPrime brokerage services is a package of services offered to large active investors,\nparticularly institutional hedge funds. The services usually include:\n• clearing, settlement and custody\n• consolidated reporting\n• financing (margin, repo or synthetic)\n• securities lending\n• capital introduction\n• risk analytics.\n(11) Any part of an operational deposit that is fully covered by deposit\ninsurance may be treated as a stable retail deposit.\n(12) An institutional network of cooperative banks is a group of legally\nseparate banks with a statutory framework of cooperation with a\npage 346 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.26\ncommon strategic focus and brand, in which certain functions are\nperformed by a central institution or a specialised service provider.\n(13) A qualifying deposit is a deposit by a member institution with the\ncentral institution or specialised central service provider:\n(a) because of statutory minimum deposit requirements; or\n(b) in the context of common task-sharing and legal, statutory or\ncontractual arrangements (but only if both the depositor and the\nbank that receives the deposit participate in the network’s scheme\nof mutual protection against illiquidity and insolvency).\n(14) The following are not qualifying deposits:\n(a) deposits resulting from correspondent banking activities;\n(b) deposits placed at the central institution or a specialised service\nprovider for any reason other than those set out in subrule (13);\n(c) deposits for the operational purposes of clearing, custody, or cash\nmanagement.\n(15) Unsecured wholesale funding provided by non-financial corporates\nand sovereigns, central banks, MDBs, and public sector enterprises\ncomprises all deposits and other extensions of unsecured funding (other\nthan those specifically for operational purposes) from:\n(a) non-financial corporate customers (except small business\ncustomers); and\n(b) domestic and foreign customers that are sovereigns, central banks,\nMDBs and public sector enterprises.\n(16) Unsecured wholesale funding provided by other legal entity customers\nconsists of deposits and other funding (other than operational deposits)\nnot falling within subrules (1) to (15), such as funding provided by:\n(a) another financial institution; or\n(b) a related party of the firm.\n(17) All debt securities issued by the firm are to be treated as unsecured\nwholesale funding provided by other legal entity customers regardless\nof the holder.\n(18) However, securities that are sold exclusively in the retail market and\nheld in retail accounts (or small business customer accounts) may be\ntreated in the appropriate retail or small business customer deposit\ncategory. For securities to be treated in that way, there must be\nlimitations preventing them being bought and held other than by retail\nor small business customers.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 347\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.3 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.3.27\n(19) Customers’ cash balances arising from the provision of prime brokerage\nservices must be treated as separate from any balances required to be\nsegregated under a statutory client protection regime, and must not be\nnetted against other customer exposures. Such offsetting balances held\nin segregated accounts are to be treated as inflows and must not be\ncounted as HQLA.\n9.3.27 Treatment of deposits pledged as security\n(1) This rule applies to a deposit that is pledged as security for a credit\nfacility if:\n(a) the facility will not mature or be settled within the relevant\n30-calendar-day period; and\n(b) the pledge is subject to a legally enforceable contract under which\nthe deposit cannot be withdrawn before the facility is fully settled\nor repaid.\n(2) If no part of the facility has been drawn, the runoff rate is the higher of:\n(a) the rate that would apply under rule 9.3.23 or 9.3.26 (as the case\nrequires); and\n(b) a rate equal to the rate applicable to the facility under rule 9.3.38.\n(3) However, if some part of the facility has been drawn, only that part of\nthe deposit in excess of the outstanding balance of the facility is to be\ncounted. The applicable runoff rate is the rate that applies under rule\n9.3.23 or 9.3.26 (as the case requires).\n9.3.28 Treatment of maturing secured funding\n(1) The runoff rates for secured funding that matures within the relevant\n30-calendar-day period are as set out in table 9.3.28.\n(2) Secured funding is a banking business firm’s liabilities and general\nobligations collateralised by the grant of legal rights to specific assets\nowned by the firm.\nGuidance\nThis scenario assumes that the firm has lost its secured funding on short-term financing\ntransactions. In this scenario, the firm could continue to transact securities financing\ntransactions only if the transactions were backed by HQLA or were with the firm’s\ndomestic sovereign, public sector enterprise or central bank.\nTable 9.3.28 Maturing secured funding—runoff rates\nItem Kind of funding Runoff\nrate (%)\n1 Backed by level 1 HQLA 0\npage 348 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.29\nItem Kind of funding Runoff\nrate (%)\n2 Backed by level 2A HQLA 15\n3 Backed by assets that are not level 1 HQLA 25\nor level 2A HQLA, and the counterparty is\nany of the following:\n• a domestic sovereign\n• an MDB\n• a domestic public sector enterprise that\nhas a risk weight of 20% or lower\n4 Backed by residential-mortgage-backed 25\nsecurities that are eligible as level 2B HQLA\n5 Backed by other level 2B HQLA 50\n6 All other maturing secured funding 100\n(3) Collateral swaps, and any other transactions of a similar form, are to be\ntreated as repo or reverse repo agreements. Collateral lent to the firm’s\ncustomers to effect short positions is to be treated as secured funding.\n(4) The firm must apply the factors to all outstanding secured funding\ntransactions with maturities within 30 calendar days, including\ncustomer short positions that do not have a specified contractual\nmaturity.\n(5) The amount of outflow is the amount of funds raised through the\ntransaction, and not the value of the underlying collateral.\nSubdivision 9.3.C.5 Calculating total expected gross cash\noutflows—runoff rates for other funding\n9.3.29 Treatment of net derivative cash outflows\n(1) The runoff rate for net derivative cash outflows is 100%.\n(2) The firm must calculate those outflows in accordance with its usual\nvaluation methods. The outflows may be calculated on a net basis by\ncounterparty (that is, inflows offsetting outflows) only if a valid master\nnetting agreement exists.\n(3) From the calculation, the firm must exclude liquidity needs that would\nresult from increased collateral needs because of falls in the value of\ncollateral lodged or market value movements.\nNote For how to treat such liquidity needs, see rules 9.3.31 and 9.3.35.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 349\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.3 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.3.30\n(4) The firm must assume that an option will be exercised if it is in the\nmoney.\n(5) If derivative payments are collateralised by HQLA, the cash outflows\nare to be calculated net of any corresponding cash or collateral inflows\nthat would result, all other things being equal, from contractual\nobligations to lodge cash or collateral with the firm.\n(6) However, subrule (5) applies only if, after the collateral were received,\nthe firm would be legally entitled and operationally able to re-\nhypothecate it.\n9.3.30 Treatment of increased liquidity needs related to\ndowngrade triggers\n(1) The runoff rate for increased liquidity needs related to downgrade\ntriggers in financing transactions, derivatives and other contracts is\n100% of the amount of collateral that the firm would be required to\nlodge for, or the contractual cash outflow associated with, any\ndowngrade up to and including a 3-notch downgrade.\nGuidance\nA downgrade trigger is a contractual condition that requires a banking business firm\nto lodge additional collateral, draw down a contingent facility or repay existing\nliabilities early if an ECRA downgrades the firm. Contracts governing derivatives and\nother transactions often have such conditions. The scenario therefore requires a firm\nto assume that for each contract that contains downgrade triggers, 100% of the\nadditional collateral or cash outflow will have to be lodged for a downgrade up to and\nincluding a 3-notch downgrade of the firm’s long-term credit rating.\n(2) The firm must assume that a downgrade trigger linked to the firm’s\nshort-term rating will be triggered at the corresponding long-term rating.\n9.3.31 Treatment of increased liquidity needs related to possible\nvaluation changes on lodged collateral\nThe runoff rate for increased liquidity needs related to possible\nvaluation changes on collateral lodged by a banking business firm to\nsecure derivatives and other transactions is 20% of the value of any\nlodged collateral that is not level 1 HQLA (net of collateral received on\na counterparty basis, if the collateral received is not subject to\nrestrictions on re-use or re-hypothecation).\nGuidance\nMost counterparties to derivative transactions are required to secure the mark-to-\nmarket valuation of their positions. If level 1 HQLA are lodged as collateral, no\nadditional stock of HQLA need be maintained for possible valuation changes.\nHowever, if the firm secures such an exposure with other collateral, 20% of the value\nof such lodged collateral will be added to the firm’s required stock of HQLA to cover\nthe possible loss of market value on the collateral.\npage 350 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.32\n9.3.32 Treatment of increased liquidity needs related to excess\nnon-segregated collateral\nThe runoff rate for increased liquidity needs related to excess non-\nsegregated collateral that is held by a banking business firm, and could\ncontractually be recalled at any time by a counterparty, is 100% of the\nvalue of the excess collateral.\n9.3.33 Treatment of increased liquidity needs related to\ncontractually-required collateral when counterparty has not\nyet demanded that collateral be lodged\nThe runoff rate for increased liquidity needs related to contractually-\nrequired collateral, due from a banking business firm on transactions for\nwhich the counterparty has not yet demanded that the collateral be\nlodged, is 100% of the value of the collateral that is contractually due.\n9.3.34 Treatment of increased liquidity needs related to contracts\nthat allow substitution of non-HQLA collateral\n(1) This rule applies to the following kinds of transaction:\n(a) transactions where:\n(i) a banking business firm holds HQLA collateral;\n(ii) the counterparty has the right to substitute non-HQLA\ncollateral for some or all of the HQLA collateral without the\nfirm’s consent; and\n(iii) the collateral is not segregated;\n(b) transactions where:\n(i) a banking business firm has the right to receive HQLA\ncollateral;\n(ii) the counterparty has the right to deliver non-HQLA collateral\ninstead of some or all of the HQLA collateral without the\nfirm’s consent; and\n(iii) the collateral is not segregated.\n(2) The runoff rate for increased liquidity needs related to such a transaction\nis 100% of the value of HQLA collateral for which non-HQLA\ncollateral can be substituted or delivered, as the case requires.\n9.3.35 Treatment of increased liquidity needs related to market\nvaluation changes on derivative instruments\n(1) The runoff rate for increased liquidity needs related to market valuation\nchanges on derivative instruments is 100% of the largest absolute net\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 351\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.3 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.3.36\ncollateral flow (based on both realised outflows and inflows) in a\n30-calendar-day period during the previous 24 months.\nGuidance\nMarket practice requires collateralisation of mark-to-market exposures on derivative\ninstruments.

The risks include:\n• being unable to refinance maturing debt\n• derivatives or derivative-like components that would allow the return of assets,\nor require the firm to provide liquidity, within the 30-calendar-day period.\nIf the firm’s structured financing activities are carried out through a special purpose\nentity (such as a conduit or structured investment vehicle), the firm should, in\ndetermining its HQLA requirements, look through to the maturity of the debt\ninstruments issued by the entity and any embedded options in financing arrangements\nthat could trigger the return of assets or the need for liquidity, regardless of whether\nthe entity is consolidated.\npage 352 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.38\n9.3.38 Treatment of drawdowns on committed credit and liquidity\nfacilities\n(1) The runoff rates for drawdowns on committed credit and liquidity\nfacilities are as set out in table 9.3.38.\n(2) A credit facility is a contractual agreement or obligation to extend funds\nin the future to a retail or wholesale counterparty.

Those rules are based on\nBasel III LCR. The interpretive provisions include only minimal explanation\nof the reasons why particular kinds of inflow receive the inflow rates\nspecified. For a fuller explanation, consult Basel III LCR.\npage 356 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.43\nGuidance\nAn inflow rate does not represent an assumption about the risk of a default—instead,\nit represents the likelihood that the relevant obligation will be rolled over (so that the\nfirm does not actually receive the cash) or that no cash will be received for some other\nreason. (The possibility of default is excluded by rule 9.3.42 (2) (a), which allows only\ninflows from performing exposures to be included.) Inflows for which an inflow rate\nof 0% is specified are effectively treated as not being receivable.\n(2) When a banking business firm is calculating its cash inflows:\n(a) it may include a contractual inflow from an exposure only if the\nexposure is classified under rule 4.3.3 as performing, and there is\nno reason to expect a default within the relevant period;\n(b) it must not include any contingent inflow; and\n(c) it must not include any inflow that would be received from an asset\nin the firm’s HQLA portfolio.\nGuidance for subrule (2) (c)\nIn a stressed situation, the assets in the firm’s HQLA portfolio would already\nhave been monetised. That is the purpose of those assets—to be monetised to\nprovide liquidity. Consequently, in a scenario of liquidity stress, the contracted\ncash inflows from them would no longer be available to the firm.\nNote When a firm calculates its total net cash outflows over a period for the\npurpose of calculating its LCR, it cannot include cash inflows over 75% of\nits total gross cash outflows over the period—see rule 9.3.21 (1) (b).\n(3) The firm may include, in cash inflows during a period, interest payments\nthat it expects to receive during the period.\nSubdivision 9.3.C.7 Calculating total expected cash inflows—\ninflow rates for secured lending and\ncommitted facilities\n9.3.43 Treatment of maturing secured lending\nThe inflow rates for secured lending that matures during the relevant 30-\ncalendar-day period are as set out in table 9.3.43.\nTable 9.3.43 Maturing secured lending—inflow rates\nItem Source of inflow Inflow rate (%)\nIf collateral If collateral re-\nnot re- hypothecated\nhypothecated\n1 Maturing secured lending\ntransactions (including margin\nlending) backed by:\n• level 1 HQLA 0 0\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 357\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.3 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.3.44\n• level 2A HQLA 15 0\n• level 2B HQLA that are 25 0\nresidential-mortgage-backed\nsecurities\n• other level 2B HQLA 50 0\n2 Maturing margin lending backed 50 0\nby collateral that is not HQLA\n3 Maturing secured lending (other 100 0\nthan margin lending) backed by\ncollateral that is not HQLA\n9.3.44 Treatment of credit and liquidity facilities\n(1) The inflow rate for credit facilities and liquidity facilities provided to\nthe firm is 0%.\n(2) Credit facility and liquidity facility have the same respective meanings\nas in rule 9.3.38.\nSubdivision 9.3.C.8 Calculating total expected cash inflows—\ninflow rates for other cash inflows\n9.3.45 Treatment of operational deposits\n(1) The inflow rate for operational deposits by the firm held at other\nfinancial institutions (including deposits held at the centralised\ninstitution of a network of co-operative banks) is 0%.\n(2) Operational deposit has the same meaning as in rule 9.3.26 (6).\n9.3.46 Treatment of net derivative cash inflows\n(1) The inflow rate for net derivative cash inflows is 100%.\n(2) The firm must calculate those inflows in accordance with its usual\nvaluation methods.

Apart from\nany other considerations, the Regulatory Authority would not approve the application\nof an option described in this Division by a banking business firm unless the Authority\nwere satisfied that the supply of HQLA denominated in Qatari riyals was insufficient\nto meet the demand for such assets from banking business firms when compared to\nthe total of firms’ liabilities denominated in that currency.\n9.3.51 Regulatory Authority approval required\nA banking business firm may apply an option described in this Division\nonly if the Regulatory Authority so approves.\n9.3.52 References to Qatari riyals—Division 9.3.E\nEach reference in this Division to Qatari riyals may be read as a\nreference to United States dollars while the exchange rate between the\nQatari riyal and the United States dollar is fixed.\n9.3.53 Option 1—contractual committed liquidity facility from\ncentral bank\n(1) Option 1 is for a banking business firm to have a liquidity facility that\ncomplies with subrule (2).\npage 360 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.54\n(2) A liquidity facility complies with this subrule if it meets all of the\nfollowing conditions:\n(a) it is established under a contract between the firm and a central\nbank;\n(b) on any day, its maturity date falls outside the 30-calendar-day\nperiod for the relevant LCR calculation;\n(c) the contract is irrevocable before its maturity;\n(d) there is no requirement for any credit decision by the central bank;\n(e) there is a fee for the facility that is charged regardless of the\namount drawn down;\n(f) the fee is set so that the net yield on the assets used to secure the\nfacility is not higher than the net yield on a representative portfolio\nof level 1 HQLA and level 2 HQLA, after adjusting for any\nmaterial differences in credit risk.\n(3) If the Regulatory Authority approves a banking business firm’s\napplication of option 1, then:\n(a) the firm may treat the liquidity facility as providing no more than\na percentage directed by the Authority of the value of the firm’s\nHQLA portfolio required to be denominated in Qatari riyals; and\n(b) the remainder of the firm’s HQLA portfolio denominated in Qatari\nriyals must be level 1 HQLA denominated in that currency.\n9.3.54 Option 2—HQLA in foreign currency to cover liquidity\nneeds in Qatari riyals\n(1) Option 2 is for a banking business firm:\n(a) to hold, as part of its HQLA portfolio, HQLA denominated in a\nparticular foreign currency in an amount that is significantly\ngreater than the amount of its liabilities that are denominated in\nthat currency; and\n(b) to match the excess of HQLA denominated in the foreign currency\nagainst liabilities denominated in Qatari riyals.\nGuidance\nWhen considering whether to approve a firm’s use of option 2, the Regulatory\nAuthority would take into account:\n• whether the levels of relevant HQLA are consistent with the firm’s foreign\nexchange risk management capacity and needs\n• whether the foreign currency is freely and reliably convertible into Qatari riyals\n• whether the firm is effectively managing its positions in the HQLA, and the\npositions would not pose undue risk to its financial strength.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 361\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.3 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.3.55\n(2) If the Regulatory Authority approves a banking business firm’s\napplication of option 2, then:\n(a) for calculating the value of the firm’s HQLA portfolio, the excess\nof HQLA denominated in the foreign currency is subject to the\nhaircut directed by the Authority;\nGuidance\nThe minimum haircut for HQLA denominated in a currency other than United\nStates dollars would be 8%, as required by Basel III LCR, paragraph 60. A lower\nhaircut might be permitted for HQLA denominated in United States dollars\nbecause the Qatari riyal is pegged to the dollar.\n(b) the firm may treat HQLA denominated in the foreign currency as\nproviding no more than a percentage directed by the Authority of\nthe required value of the firm’s HQLA portfolio denominated in\nQatari riyals;

appropriate liquidity conversion factor. The principal\namount of an asset on a day is taken to be:\n(a) for gold bullion or a marketable security—the asset’s fair value at\nthe close of business on the previous working day; and\nNote In relation to an asset’s fair value and adjustments that may be\nrequired, see rule 9.4.5.\n(b) for any other asset—its book value (including accrued interest, if\nany) at the close of business on the

funding ratio—liquidity\nrisk group A banking business\nfirms\nNotes for Part 9.5\n1 This Part applies only to liquidity risk group A banking business firms—see\nrule 9.1.4.\n2 For more detail and explanation see Basel III: the Net Stable Funding Ratio,\npublished by the BCBS in October 2014 and available at\nhttp://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d295.pdf.\nDivision 9.5.A General\n9.5.1 Introduction—Part 9.5\n(1) The requirement for a banking business firm to maintain a net stable\nfunding ratio is one of the BCBS’s key reforms to promote a more\nresilient banking sector. The requirement will oblige firms to maintain\na stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and\noff-balance-sheet activities.\n(2) A stable funding profile is intended to reduce the likelihood that\ndisruptions to a firm’s regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity\nposition in a way that would increase the risk of its failure, and might\nlead to broader systemic stress.\n(3) The requirement is intended to limit firms’ reliance on short-term\nwholesale funding, promote funding stability, and encourage better\nassessment of funding risk on and off firms’ balance-sheets.\n9.5.2 Definitions for Part 9.5\n(1) In this Part:\nASF for a liquidity risk group A banking business firm means the\namount of its available stable funding, calculated in accordance with\nthis Part.\ncarrying value of a capital instrument, liability or asset is the value\ngiven for the instrument, liability or asset in the prudential returns of the\nfirm concerned.\nnet stable funding ratio has the meaning given by rule 9.5.3.\nNSFR means net stable funding ratio.\nRSF for a liquidity risk group A banking business firm means the\namount of its required stable funding, calculated in accordance with this\nPart.\npage 378 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nNet stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.5\nRule 9.5.3\n(2) Expressions used in this Part that are defined in Part 9.3 have the same\nrespective meanings in this Part as in Part 9.3.\nNote The following expressions, used in this Part, are defined in Part 9.3:\n• credit facility (see rule 9.3.38)\n• encumbered and unencumbered (see rule 9.3.4)\n• financial institution (see rule 9.3.3)\n• HQLA (and references to levels of HQLA) (see rule 9.3.3 and rules 9.3.10 to\n9.3.13)\n• liquidity facility (see rule 9.3.38).\n9.5.3 What NSFR is\n(1) A liquidity risk group A banking business firm’s NSFR, expressed as a\npercentage, is:\n𝐴𝑆𝐹\n×100.\n𝑅𝑆𝐹\n(2) The ASF and RSF are to be calculated in accordance with this Part.\n9.5.4 Obligation to maintain NSFR\nA liquidity risk group A banking business firm must maintain an NSFR\nof at least 100%. That is, its ASF must always be equal to or greater than\nits RSF.\n9.5.5 Obligation to notify Regulatory Authority if NSFR\nrequirement not met\n(1) A liquidity risk group A banking business firm must notify the\nRegulatory Authority in writing immediately (but within 3 business\ndays) if the firm ceases to meet its NSFR requirement (or becomes\naware of circumstances that may result in its ceasing to meet that\nrequirement).\n(2) In the notification the firm must clearly explain:\n(a) why it ceased to meet, or thinks it may cease to meet, the\nrequirement;\n(b) when it expects to again be able to meet the requirement; and\n(c) what it has done and will do to ensure that it meets the requirement\nin future, or continues to meet it, as the case requires.\nGuidance\nA banking business firm that gives such a notification should discuss with the\nRegulatory Authority what further steps it should take to deal with the situation.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 379\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.5 Net stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.5.6\n9.5.6 Application of NSFR to financial group\n(1) For calculating a consolidated NSFR for a financial group, assets held\nto meet a banking business firm’s NSFR may be included in the parent\nentity’s stable funding only so far as the related liabilities are reflected\nin the parent entity’s NSFR. Any surplus of assets held at the firm may\nbe treated as forming part of the parent entity’s stable funding only if\nthose assets would be freely available to the parent entity during a period\nof stress.\n(2) When calculating its NSFR on a consolidated basis, a cross-border\nbanking group must apply the rules of its home jurisdiction to all the\nlegal entities being consolidated, except for the treatment of retail and\nsmall business deposits. Such deposits for a consolidated entity must be\ntreated according to the rules in the jurisdiction in which the entity\noperates.\n(3) A cross-border banking group must not take excess stable funding into\naccount in calculating its consolidated NSFR if there is reasonable doubt\nabout whether the funding would be available during a period of stress.\nGuidance\nAsset transfer restrictions (for example, ring-fencing measures, non-convertibility of\nlocal currency, foreign exchange controls) in jurisdictions in which a banking group\noperates would affect the availability of liquidity by restricting the transfer of assets\nand funding within the group. The consolidated NSFR should reflect the restrictions\nconsistently with this Part. For example, assets held to meet a local NSFR requirement\nby a subsidiary that is being consolidated can be included in the consolidated NSFR\nto the extent that the assets are used to cover the funding requirements of that\nsubsidiary, even if the assets are subject to restrictions on transfer. If the assets held in\nexcess of the total funding requirements are not transferable, the firm should not count\nthat funding.\n9.5.7 Determining maturity of instruments when calculating\nNSFR\n(1) When a banking business firm is determining the maturity of an equity\nor liability instrument, it must assume that a call option will be exercised\nat the earliest possible date.\n(2) In particular, if the market expects a liability to be exercised before its\nlegal final maturity date, the firm must assign the liability to the\ncategory that is consistent with the market expectation.\n(3) For long-dated liabilities, the firm may treat only the part of cash flows\nfalling at or beyond the 6-month and 1-year time horizons as having an\neffective residual maturity of 6 months or more and 1 year or more,\nrespectively.\npage 380 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nNet stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms Part 9.5\nRule 9.5.8\n9.5.8 Calculating NSFR derivative liability amounts\n(1) A banking business firm must calculate the value of a derivative liability\nbased on the replacement cost for the derivative contract (obtained by\nmarking to market) if the contract has a negative value.\n(2) If there is a netting agreement with the counterparty that meets both of\nthe conditions in subrule (3), and all of the other conditions in\nsubrule (4) are met, the replacement cost for the set of exposures\ncovered by the agreement is taken to be the net replacement cost.\n(3) The conditions for the netting agreement are as follows:\n(a) under the agreement the firm would have a claim to receive, or an\nobligation to pay, only the net amount of the mark-to-market\nvalues of the transactions if the counterparty were to fail to\nperform;\n(b) the agreement does not contain a walkaway clause.\n(4) The other conditions are as follows:\n(a) the firm holds a written, reasoned legal opinion that the relevant\ncourts and administrative authorities would find the firm’s\nexposure to be the net amount referred to in subrule (3) (a) under\neach of the following laws:\n(i) the law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is\nestablished;\n(ii) if a foreign branch of the counterparty is involved, the law of\nthe jurisdiction in which the branch is located;\n(iii) the law that governs the individual transactions;\n(iv) the law that governs the netting agreement (and any other\nagreement necessary to effect the netting);\n(b) the firm has procedures to ensure that netting arrangements are\nkept under review in the light of possible changes in the relevant\nlaw;\n(c) the Regulatory Authority is satisfied that the netting agreement is\nenforceable under all of the laws referred to in paragraph (a).\n(5) Collateral lodged in the form of variation margin in connection with\nderivative contracts, regardless of the asset type, must be deducted from\nthe negative replacement cost amount.\n9.5.9 Determining maturity of assets\n(1) When determining the maturity of an asset, a banking business firm\nmust assume that any option to extend that maturity will be exercised.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 381\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.5 Net stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group A banking business firms\nRule 9.5.10\n(2) In particular, if the market expects the maturity of an asset to be\nextended, the firm must assign the asset to the category that is consistent\nwith the market expectation.\n(3) For an amortising loan, the firm may treat the part that comes due within\n1 year as having residual maturity of less than 1 year.\n9.5.10 What assets should be included\n(1) Subject to subrule (2), when determining its RSF, a banking business\nfirm:\n(a) must include financial instruments, foreign currencies and\ncommodities for which a purchase order has been executed;

The requirement will oblige firms to\nmaintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their\nassets and off-balance-sheet activities.\n(2) A stable funding profile is intended to reduce the likelihood that\ndisruptions to a firm’s regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity\nposition in a way that would increase the risk of its failure and might\nlead to broader systemic stress.\n(3) The requirement is intended to limit firms’ reliance on short-term\nwholesale funding, promote funding stability, and encourage better\nassessment of funding risk on and off firms’ balance-sheets.\n(4) This Part sets out an alternative approach to the maintenance of stable\nfunding that is intended to be appropriate for certain banking business\nfirms that, because of their business model, could not meet a\nrequirement to maintain a net stable funding ratio in accordance with\nPart 9.5.\n9.6.2 Definitions for Part 9.6\nExpressions used in this Part that are defined in Part 9.3 or 9.5 have the\nsame respective meanings in this Part as in Part 9.3 or 9.5, as the case\nmay be.\n9.6.3 What NSFR is\n(1) A liquidity risk group B banking business firm’s NSFR, expressed as a\npercentage, is:\n𝐴𝑆𝐹\n×100.\n𝑅𝑆𝐹\n(2) The ASF and RSF are to be calculated in accordance with this Part.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 393\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.6 Net stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group B banking business firms\nRule 9.6.4\n9.6.4 Obligation to maintain NSFR\nA liquidity risk group B banking business firm must maintain, during\neach calendar month, an average NSFR of at least the percentage that\nthe Regulatory Authority directs the firm to maintain.\n9.6.5 Obligation to notify Regulatory Authority if NSFR\nrequirement not met\n(1) A liquidity risk group B banking business firm must notify the\nRegulatory Authority in writing immediately (but within 3 business\ndays) if the firm ceases to meet its NSFR requirement (or becomes\naware of circumstances that may result in its ceasing to meet that\nrequirement).\n(2) In the notification the firm must clearly explain:\n(a) why it ceased to meet, or thinks it may cease to meet, the\nrequirement;\n(b) when it expects to again be able to meet the requirement;

and\n(b) 8–30 calendar days.\nGuidance\n1 A liability is said to be payable at sight if payment is due immediately on\npresentation. For example, a cheque is usually payable at sight.\n2 On a particular day, the sight–7 calendar days time-band covers assets maturing,\nor liabilities payable, on presentation or within 7 calendar days. The 8–30\ncalendar days time-band covers assets maturing, or liabilities payable, from 8 to\n30 calendar days later.\n3 This Part takes no account of assets or liabilities with an unspecified maturity, or\na specified maturity that is more than 30 calendar days in the future.\n9.7.2 Application—Part 9.7\nThis Part applies to all banking business firms.\n9.7.3 Determining net cumulative maturity mismatch\nA banking business firm determines its net cumulative maturity\nmismatch for each time-band by:\n(a) determining what assets and liabilities are to be taken into account,\nand their maturities;\n(b) assigning each asset and each liability to a time-band;\n(c) adding up the values of the assets and the liabilities assigned to\neach time-band; and\n(d) subtracting liabilities from assets in each time-band.\n9.7.4 Assigning liabilities to time-bands\n(1) A liability must be assigned to a time-band according to its earliest\ncontractual maturity.\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 399\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.7 Limits on net cumulative maturity mismatch\nRule 9.7.5\n(2) A contingent liability must be included in the firm’s liabilities unless\nthe conditions necessary to crystallise it are unlikely to be fulfilled.\nGuidance for subrule (2)\nIn deciding whether it is likely that the conditions necessary to crystallise a contingent\nliability will be fulfilled, an authorised firm could rely on general market information,\nits knowledge of the counterparty and general behavioural analysis.\n9.7.5 Assigning assets to time-bands\n(1) An asset must be assigned to a time-band according to its latest\ncontractual maturity, except that:\n(a) an undrawn committed standby facility provided by another\nbanking business firm is to be treated as being at sight;\n(b) readily marketable assets (see subrule (2)) are to be treated as being\nat sight; and\n(c) assets that have been lodged as collateral are not to be included.\n(2) An asset is readily marketable if all of the following are true:\n(a) the currency in which it is denominated is freely tradeable;\n(b) prices are regularly quoted for it;\n(c) it is regularly traded;\n(d) it can readily be monetised on a recognised exchange.\n(3) On a case by case basis, the Regulatory Authority may allow a banking\nbusiness firm to assign, to the sight–7 calendar days time-band, a\nlonger-term asset that is relatively easy to monetise.\n9.7.6 Haircuts for readily marketable assets\n(1) The haircuts to be applied to readily marketable assets of each kind are\nas set out in table 9.7.6. The haircut for an asset is to be applied to the\nmark-to-market value of the asset.\n(2) For the table, an asset is investment grade if it is rated no lower than\nBBB- (long-term) or A-3 (short-term) by Standard & Poor’s (or the\nequivalent by another ECRA).\npage 400 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nLimits on net cumulative maturity mismatch Part 9.7\nRule 9.7.6\nTable 9.7.6 Haircuts for assets\nItem Kind of asset Haircut\n(%)\nA.

and\n(d) LCR by significant currencies.\n9.8.2 What monitoring requires\nA requirement in this Part for a banking business firm to monitor an\nindicator requires the firm to be continuously aware of the indicator, and\nto re-evaluate it as often as necessary, given:\n(a) the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s business; and\n(b) the prevailing market conditions.\nDivision 9.8.B Monitoring maturity mismatches\n9.8.3 Purpose of monitoring\nThe monitoring of a banking business firm’s contractual maturity\nmismatches is intended to identify gaps between contractual inflows and\noutflows in particular time-bands, and to reveal the extent to which the\nfirm relies on maturity transformation.\n9.8.4 Contractual maturity mismatch\n(1) A banking business firm:\n(a) must monitor its contractual maturity mismatches, according to\ntime-bands directed by the Regulatory Authority; and\n(b) must carry out its own maturity mismatch analyses, based on\nrealistic, going-concern assumptions about the behaviour of\ninflows and outflows of funds in both normal situations and stress\nsituations.\n(2) The analyses should be based on the firm’s strategic and business plans\nand must be shared with, and discussed with, the Authority.\npage 404 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nMonitoring Part 9.8\nRule 9.8.5\n(3) The firm must be able to show how it plans to bridge any identified gaps\nin its internally generated maturity mismatches, and to explain any\ndifferences between the assumptions applied and the contractual terms.\nDivision 9.8.C Monitoring concentration of funding\n9.8.5 Purpose of monitoring\nThe monitoring of the concentration of a banking business firm’s\nfunding is meant:\n(a) to identify sources of the firm’s wholesale funding that are of such\nsignificance that the withdrawal of that funding could cause\nliquidity problems for the firm; and\n(b) therefore, to encourage the firm to diversify its sources of such\nfunding.\n9.8.6 What is to be monitored\nA banking business firm must monitor:\n(a) concentration of funding by counterparty;\n(b) concentration of funding by instrument or product; and\n(c) concentration of funding by significant currency.\n9.8.7 Concentration of funding by counterparty\n(1) A banking business firm must calculate its concentration of funding by\ncounterparty as a percentage for each significant counterparty or\nsignificant group of connected counterparties, by means of the\nfollowing formula:\n𝑁\n×100\n𝑇\nwhere:\nN is the total, for the counterparty or group, of:\n(a) all liabilities to the counterparty or group; and\n(b) all other direct borrowings, both secured and unsecured (such as\nby overnight commercial paper or certificates of deposit) from the\ncounterparty or group.\nT is the firm’s total balance-sheet.\n(2) For subrule (1):\n(a) a counterparty or group is significant if liabilities to it account in\ntotal for more than 1% of the firm’s total liabilities; and\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 405\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.8 Monitoring\nRule 9.8.8\n(b) a group of connected counterparties is 2 or more counterparties\nthat are connected (as defined in rule 5.1.3).\n(3) For this rule, if the firm is a member of a corporate group, the firm must\ntreat intra-group deposits and deposits from related parties as deposits\nby a single counterparty.\nGuidance\nDeposits from within the group and from related parties are to be identified because\nof the possible limitations on intra-group transactions under stressed conditions.\n9.8.8 Concentration of funding by instrument or product\n(1) A banking business firm must calculate its concentration of funding by\ninstrument or product as a percentage for each significant instrument or\nsignificant product (or significant type of instrument or significant type\nof product), by means of the following formula:\n𝑁\n×100\n𝑇\nwhere:\nN is the total, for the instrument or product (or type of instrument or\ntype of product) of all liabilities arising from the instrument, product or\ntype of instrument or product.\nT is the firm’s total balance-sheet.\n(2) For subrule (1), an instrument or product, or a type of instrument or\nproduct, is significant if it accounts in total for more than 1% of the\nfirm’s total liabilities.\n9.8.9 Concentration of funding by currency\n(1) A banking business firm must monitor its concentration of funding by\ncurrency by maintaining a list of its liabilities, maturing in each time-\nband, denominated in each significant currency.\n(2) For subrule (1):\n(a) a currency is significant for the firm if liabilities denominated in it\naccount in total for more than 5% of the firm’s total liabilities; and\n(b) the time-bands are as follows:\n(i) less than 30 calendar days;\n(ii) 1-3 months;\n(iii) 3-6 months;\n(iv) 6-12 months;\n(v) more than 12 months;\n(vi) unspecified maturity.\npage 406 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 9\nMonitoring Part 9.8\nRule 9.8.10\nDivision 9.8.D Monitoring available unencumbered\nassets\n9.8.10 Purpose of monitoring\nThe monitoring of a banking business firm’s available unencumbered\nassets and collateral is meant to track assets and collateral:\n(a) that could be used in secondary markets as collateral to raise\nadditional HQLA (as defined in rule 9.3.3) or secured funding; or\n(b) that would be eligible as collateral for a central bank’s standing\nfacility.\n9.8.11 What is to be monitored\n(1) In this rule:\nunencumbered has the meaning given by rule 9.3.4 (1).\n(2) A banking business firm must monitor all of the following:\n(a) the amount, type and location of the firm’s available\nunencumbered assets that are useable as collateral in secondary\nmarkets;\n(b) collateral, received from customers, that the firm is permitted to\ndeliver or re-pledge, and how much of such collateral it is\ndelivering or re-pledging;\n(c) the firm’s available unencumbered assets that are eligible as\ncollateral for central banks’ standing facilities;\n(d) the estimated haircut that the secondary market or relevant central\nbank would require for each asset;\n(e) the costs likely to be involved.\n(3) In doing so, the firm must categorise its available unencumbered assets\nand collateral by significant currency. A currency is significant if the\nfirm’s stock of available unencumbered assets and collateral\ndenominated in the currency amounts to 5% or more of the firm’s total\namount of such assets and collateral.\n(4) The firm must monitor:\n(a) the expected monetised value of such assets and collateral (rather\nthan their notional amount); and\n(b) where the assets or collateral are held (in terms of both their\nlocation and what business lines have access to them).\nV12 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 page 407\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Liquidity risk\nPart 9.8 Monitoring\nRule 9.8.12\nDivision 9.8.E Monitoring LCR by significant\ncurrencies\n9.8.12 Purpose of monitoring\nThe monitoring of a banking business firm’s LCR (as defined in\nrule 9.3.3) by significant currencies is meant to track possible currency\nmismatches.\n9.8.13 What is to be monitored\n(1) A banking business firm must monitor:\n(a) its stock of HQLA (as defined in rule 9.3.3) in each significant\ncurrency; and\n(b) its expected total net cash outflows (net of any hedges) in each\nsuch currency over the next 30 calendar days.\n(2) For subrule (1):\n(a) the firm’s total net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days\nare to be calculated in accordance with rule 9.3.21; and\n(b) a currency is significant for the firm if liabilities denominated in it\namount to 5% or more of the firm’s total liabilities.\npage 408 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGroup risk Chapter 10\nGeneral Part 10.1\nRule 10.1.1\nChapter 10 Group risk\nPart 10.1 General\n10.1.1 Introduction\n(1) This Chapter sets out the requirements for a banking business firm’s\nmanagement of corporate group risk and the measurement of financial\ngroup capital requirement and resources.\n(2) Group membership can be a source of both strength and weakness to a\nbanking business firm. The purpose of group risk requirements is to\nensure that the firm takes into account the risks related to its\nmembership of a corporate group and maintains adequate capital\nresources so as to exceed its financial group capital requirement.\n10.1.2 Corporate group and financial group\n(1) A banking business firm’s corporate group is made up of:\n(a) the firm;\n(b) any parent entity of the firm;\n(c) any subsidiary (direct or indirect) of the firm; and\n(d) any subsidiary (direct or indirect) of a parent entity of the firm.\n(2) A banking business firm’s financial group is made up of:\n(a) the firm;\n(b) any subsidiary (direct or indirect) of the firm, if the subsidiary\nbelongs to a sector of the financial industry; and\n(c) any entity that the Regulatory Authority directs the firm to include.\nNote The instructions for preparing returns divide the financial industry into the\nfollowing sectors: banking, non-life insurance, life insurance, financial\nservices, equity investments and non-equity investments.\n(3) A banking business firm may apply to the Regulatory Authority for\napproval to exclude an entity from its financial group. The authority will\ngrant such an approval only after the firm satisfies the authority that\ninclusion of the entity would be misleading or inappropriate for the\npurposes of supervision.\nGuidance\nThe Regulatory Authority would consider a range of factors when requiring a banking\nbusiness firm to treat another entity as part of its financial group.

The systems must include a\nmeans of analysing realistic scenarios and the effects on the financial\ngroup’s capital requirement and resources if those scenarios occurred.\n10.1.4 Role of governing body—group risk\nA banking business firm’s governing body must ensure that the firm’s\ngroup risk management policy addresses, on a group-wide basis, all\nrisks arising from the firm’s relationship with every other member of its\ngroup.\npage 410 Banking Business Prudential Rules 2014 V12\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGroup risk Chapter 10\nGroup capital requirement and resources Part 10.2\nRule 10.2.1\nPart 10.2 Group capital requirement and\nresources\n10.2.1 Application of Part 10.2\n(1) This Part does not apply to a banking business firm if:\n(a) the firm is already subject to group prudential supervision by the\nRegulatory Authority because another member of its group is an\nauthorised firm;

Rules 2011 (CAPI).\n1.1.2 Commencement\nThese rules commence on 1 July 2011.\n1.1.3 Effect of definitions, notes and examples\n(1) A definition in the Glossary also applies to any instructions or\ndocument made under these rules.\n(2) A note in or to these rules is explanatory and is not part of these rules.\nHowever, examples and guidance are part of these rules.\n(3) An example is not exhaustive, and may extend, but does not limit, the\nmeaning of these rules or the particular provision of these rules to\nwhich it relates.\nNote Under FSR, article 17 (4), guidance is indicative of the view of the\nRegulatory Authority at the time and in the circumstances in which it was\ngiven.\nV9 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 page 1\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General provisions\nPart 1.2 Key terms and basic concepts\nRule 1.2.1\nPart 1.2 Key terms and basic concepts\n1.2.1 QFC captive insurers and their classes\n(1) A QFC captive insurer is an authorised firm (or firm) with an\nauthorisation for captive insurance business as a class 1, class 2,\nclass 3 or class 4 captive insurer.\nNote Authorised firm (or firm), authorisation and the classes of QFC captive\ninsurers are defined in the glossary.\n(2) An insurer that is not incorporated in the QFC cannot be a QFC\ncaptive insurer.\nNote Unlike some other regulated entities, QFC captive insurers are not\nallowed to operate as a branch.\n1.2.2 What is captive insurance business?\n(1) Captive insurance business is the business of effecting or carrying\nout contracts of insurance as a class 1, class 2, class 3 or class 4\ncaptive insurer.\n(2) For this purpose, a class 1, class 2, class 3 or class 4 captive insurer\nmay effect or carry out contracts that are limited to contracts of\nreinsurance for risks insured by the cedent.\nNote Contract of insurance, contract of reinsurance and cedent are defined\nin the glossary.\n1.2.3 Who is a class 1 captive insurer?\nA class 1 captive insurer is a QFC captive insurer that is permitted\nunder the conditions of its authorisation to effect or carry out\ncontracts of insurance only for risks related to or arising out of the\nbusiness or operations of the group to which the insurer belongs.\nNote Group is defined in the glossary.\n1.2.4 Who is a class 2 captive insurer?\nA class 2 captive insurer is a QFC captive insurer that is permitted\nunder the conditions of its authorisation to obtain no more than 20%\nof its gross written premium from third party risks arising from\npage 2 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 V9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral provisions Chapter 1\nKey terms and basic concepts Part 1.2\nRule 1.2.5\nbusiness or operations that are closely linked to the business or\noperations of the group to which the insurer belongs.\nGuidance\nA firm applying to become a class 2 captive insurer will need to include in its\napplication to the Regulatory Authority details of—\n(a) the third party risks it expects to insure; and\n(b) the close links between the businesses or operations mentioned in the\nrule.\nIn addition to the 20% cap in this rule, other limitations will most likely be imposed\nby the Regulatory Authority to ensure that the firm, for its closely-linked business,\nis restricted to only effecting and carrying out contracts of insurance for the closely-\nlinked business described in its application.\nExample of close links\nA construction company that offers health insurance to its employees through a\ncaptive insurer may also want to extend that coverage to self-employed contractors\nworking for the company. Although the self-employed contractors are considered\nunrelated to the construction company, a class 2 captive insurer for the company\nmay be allowed to provide health insurance cover (up to 20% of its business)\nbecause of the self-employed contractors’ close association to the construction\ncompany that owns the captive insurer.\n1.2.5 Who is a class 3 captive insurer?\nA class 3 captive insurer is a QFC captive insurer that—\n(a) is permitted under the conditions of its authorisation to effect or\ncarry out contracts of insurance only for risks related to or\narising out of the business or operations of persons who engage\nin similar, related or common—\n(i) businesses; or\n(ii) activities; or\n(iii) trade; or\n(iv) services; or\n(v) operations; and\n(b) is owned by the persons mentioned in paragraph (a) or by a body\ncorporate of which all such persons are members.\nV9 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 page 3\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General provisions\nPart 1.2 Key terms and basic concepts\nRule 1.2.6\n1.2.6 Regulatory Authority may authorise entity as class 4\ncaptive insurer\n(1) The Regulatory Authority may decide that an entity that does not\nmeet the requirements for class 1 captive insurer, class 2 captive\ninsurer or class 3 captive insurer is a class 4 captive insurer.\nNote Entity is defined in the glossary.\n(2) Without limiting subrule (1), the Regulatory Authority may take into\naccount the following matters in deciding whether an entity is a class\n4 captive insurer:\n(a) the business rationale for making the entity a captive insurer;\n(b) the use or non-use of the entity as a risk management tool;\n(c) the nature of the interests of the shareholders or members of the\nentity and whether they are aligned, or have some commonality\nwith, the policyholder;\n(d) any unique or expert knowledge of the shareholders or members\nof the entity about the risks to be insured;\n(e) the appropriateness of the structure for the proposed activities or\nwhether the business is more akin to a commercial insurer.\nGuidance\nA protected cell company that is to conduct captive insurance business is usually\nset up to insure risks that are not those of the owner of the protected cell company,\nso would normally be authorised as a class 4 captive insurer.\n1.2.7 Who is a captive insurance manager?\nA captive insurance manager is an authorised firm (or firm) with an\nauthorisation for captive insurance management.\n1.2.8 What is captive insurance management?\nCaptive insurance management is the administration of, and exercise\nof managerial functions for, a QFC captive insurer, and includes the\nadministration of contracts of insurance for the insurer.\nNote 1 Exercise and functions are defined in the glossary.\npage 4 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 V9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral provisions Chapter 1\nKey terms and basic concepts Part 1.2\nRule 1.2.8\nNote 2 Captive insurance management is a regulated activity (see Insurance\nMediation Business Rules 2011, rule 1.2.6).\nV9 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 page 5\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 2 Prudential requirements\nPart 2.1 Prudential requirements—general\nRule 2.1.1\nChapter 2 Prudential requirements\nPart 2.1 Prudential requirements—\ngeneral\n2.1.1 Financial resources—general requirement\n(1) A firm that is a QFC captive insurer must have, at all times, financial\nresources of the kinds and amounts required by, and calculated in\naccordance with, this chapter.\n(2) A firm must also have, at all times, additional financial resources that\nare adequate for the nature, size and complexity of its business to\nensure that there is no significant risk that liabilities cannot be met as\nthey fall due.\n(3) A firm must have systems and controls to enable it—\n(a) to monitor its minimum capital and solvency requirements; and\n(b) to show, at all times, whether it complies with this part.\nGuidance\nFor rule 2.1.1 (2), the firm’s governing body should assess whether the minimum\nfinancial resources required by these rules are adequate for the firm’s business.\nAdditional financial resources should be maintained by the firm if its governing\nbody considers that the required minimum financial resources do not adequately\nreflect the risks of the firm’s business.\n2.1.2 References to particular currencies\nIn these rules, the specification of an amount of money in a particular\ncurrency is also taken to specify the equivalent sum in any other\ncurrency at the relevant time.\npage 6 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 V9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nPrudential requirements Chapter 2\nMinimum capital requirements Part 2.2\nRule 2.2.1\nPart 2.2 Minimum capital requirements\n2.2.1 Firms must have minimum capital\n(1) A firm that is a QFC captive insurer must have, at all times, the\nminimum capital required under this part.\n(2) The minimum capital requirement for a firm is the highest of the\nfollowing:\n(a) the base capital requirement for the firm under rule 2.2.2;\n(b) the premium risk component under rule 2.2.3;\n(c) the outstanding claims risk component under rule 2.2.4 or\nrule 2.2.5.\nNote The minimum capital requirement of a firm is made up of eligible capital\nof the firm under chapter 3.\n2.2.2 What is a firm’s base capital requirement?\nThe base capital requirement for a firm is—\n(a) for a class 1 captive insurer—QR540,000;\n(b) for a class 2 captive insurer—QR1.4 million unless the\nRegulatory Authority determines another amount for the firm;\n(c) for a class 3 captive insurer—QR900,000; or\n(d) for a class 4 captive insurer—QR3.6 million unless the\nRegulatory Authority determines another amount for the firm.\n2.2.3 What is a firm’s premium risk component?\nThe premium risk component for a class 1, class 2, class 3 or class 4\ncaptive insurer is the amount calculated in accordance with the\nfollowing formula:\n[20%  firm’s net written premium up to QR18 million]\n+\n[15% firm’s net written premium in excess of QR18 million]\nV9 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 page 7\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\n\nChapter 2 Prudential requirements\nPart 2.2 Minimum capital requirements\nRule 2.2.4\n2.2.4 Outstanding claims risk component—firms conducting\ngeneral insurance business\n(1) The outstanding claims risk component for a class 1, class 2, class 3\nor class 4 captive insurer that conducts general insurance business is\nthe amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:\n[5%  firm’s net claims reserve on property insurance]\n+\n[15% firm’s net claims reserve on liability insurance]\nwhere:\nnet claims reserve on property insurance is the amount of the firm’s\nnet claims reserve on property insurance under general insurance\ncontracts in categories 3 to 9 in the Financial Services Regulations,\nschedule 3, part 3, paragraph 10.3.\nnet claims reserve on liability insurance is the amount of the firm’s\nnet claims reserve on liability insurance under general insurance\ncontracts in categories 1, 2 and 10 to 18 in the Financial Services\nRegulations, schedule 3, part 3, paragraph 10.3.\nnet claims reserve, as at a date, is the amount of the firm’s provisions\nfor—\n(a) claims incurred but not yet paid as at the date, including claims\nincurred but not yet reported; and\n(b) direct and indirect claims settlement expenses for those claims;\nless the amount of reinsurance and other recoveries expected to be\nreceived in respect of those claims.\n(2) Despite subrule (1), the Regulatory Authority may, by written notice,\ndirect a firm (whether on application of the firm or on the authority’s\nown initiative) to include a particular contract of insurance or\ncategory of contracts of insurance in the firm’s net claims reserve on\nproperty insurance or net claims reserve on liability insurance.\nNote In deciding whether a particular contract of insurance or category of\ncontracts of insurance is to be included in the firm’s net claims reserve\npage 8 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 V9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\n\nPrudential requirements Chapter 2\nMinimum capital requirements Part 2.2\nRule 2.2.5\non property insurance (at 5%) or net claims reserve on liability insurance\n(at 15%), the Regulatory Authority may consider, among other factors—\n(a) who would potentially be affected by the failure of the firm; and\n(b) whether the technical provisions for the contract have a lot of\nvolatility or have the potential for adverse deviation.\nFor example, contracts of insurance where the failure of the firm affects\nthird parties will usually be treated at the higher percentage. Thus, the\nfailure of a firm that has group health insurance for its owner’s business\ncould significantly affect individual employees and will be treated at the\nhigher percentage. In contrast contracts of insurance (such as those that\ninsure against pure property risks) where the failure of the firm would\nonly financially affect the owner, will usually be treated at the lower\npercentage.\n2.2.5 Outstanding claims risk component—firms conducting\nlife insurance business\nThe outstanding claims risk component for a class 1, class 2, class 3\nor class 4 captive insurer that conducts life insurance business is 2.5%\nof the policyholder liabilities calculated using actuarial methods for\nlife insurance.\nNote The following tables summarise the percentages for the premium risk\ncomponent and outstanding claims risk component for captive insurers.\nV9 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 page 9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 2 Prudential requirements\nPart 2.2 Minimum capital requirements\nRule 2.2.6\nPremium risk component for captive insurers conducting Percentage\ngeneral insurance business or life insurance business (see\nrule 2.2.3)\nFirst QR18 million of net written premium 20%\nPLUS\nNet written premium in excess of QR18 million 15%\nOutstanding claims risk component for captive insurers Percentage\nconducting general insurance business (see rule 2.2.4)\nNet claims reserve on property insurance 5%\nPLUS\nNet claims reserve on liability insurance 15%\nOutstanding claims risk component for captive insurers Percentage\nconducting life insurance business( see rule 2.2.5)\nPolicyholder liabilities calculated using actuarial methods for life insurance 2.5%\n2.2.6 Regulatory Authority to have regard to certain matters\n(1) In determining an amount for a class 2 or class 4 captive insurer under\nthis part, the Regulatory Authority must have regard to the nature,\nscale and complexity of the firm’s business.\n(2) Without limiting subrule (1), the Regulatory Authority may, in\ndetermining an amount for a class 2 captive insurer, take into account\nthe following:\n(a) the third party risks the captive insurer expects to insure;\n(b) how closely linked the business or operations giving rise to the\nthird party risks are to the business or operations of the group to\nwhich the captive insurer belongs;\n(c) the percentage of gross written premium (up to 20%) that\ncaptive insurer intends to obtain from third party risks;\n(d) any burden or undue risks to the cedent or other policyholders.\npage 10 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 V9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nPrudential requirements Chapter 2\nMinimum capital requirements Part 2.2\nRule 2.2.7\n(3) Without limiting subrule (1), the Regulatory Authority may take into\naccount the matters in rule 1.2.6 (2) (Regulatory Authority may\nauthorise entity as class 4 captive insurer) in determining an amount\nfor a class 4 captive insurer.\n2.2.7 Obligation to tell Regulatory Authority about breach of\npart 2.2\nIf a firm that is a QFC captive insurer becomes aware, or has\nreasonable grounds to believe, that it is or may be (or may be about\nto be) in breach of any provision of this part, it must—\n(a) tell the Regulatory Authority orally about the matter\nimmediately, but within 1 business day; and\n(b) by written notice given to the authority by no later than the next\nbusiness day—\n(i) confirm the oral notification; and\n(ii) explain the nature of the breach or why the firm considers\nit may be (or may be about to be) in breach of the\nprovision; and\n(iii) set out the action that the firm proposes to take about the\nbreach or to avoid the breach; and\n(c) not make any distribution to its shareholders or members,\nwhether by way of dividends or otherwise, without the\nauthority’s written permission.\nExamples—meaning of ‘within 1 business day’\n1 If, on a business day, the firm becomes aware that it may be in breach of this\npart, the firm must tell the Regulatory Authority immediately, but on that day.\n2 If, on a day that is not a business day, the firm becomes aware that it may be\nin breach of this part, the firm must tell the Regulatory Authority immediately,\nbut by no later than the next business day.\nNote Business day is defined in the glossary.\nGuidance\nIn dealing with a breach, or possible breach, of this part, the Regulatory Authority’s\nprimary concern will be the interests of existing and prospective policyholders and\nclients.

In such\ncircumstances, it will be in the interests of all parties for there to be minimum\ndisruption to the firm’s business. The authority’s normal approach will be to seek\nto work cooperatively with firms to deal with any problems. There will, however,\nbe circumstances in which it is necessary to take regulatory action to avoid exposing\nfurther policyholders and clients to the risk of the firm’s failure, and the authority\nwill not hesitate to take appropriate action if it considers this necessary.\npage 12 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 V9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nPrudential requirements Chapter 2\nPrudential requirements—other provisions Part 2.3\nRule 2.3.1\nPart 2.3 Prudential requirements—other\nprovisions\nDivision 2.3.A Prudential returns\n2.3.1 Preparation of prudential returns\n(1) A firm that is a QFC captive insurer must prepare the annual\nprudential returns that it is required to prepare by the Regulatory\nAuthority by written notice published on an approved website.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice given to a firm—\n(a) require the firm to prepare additional prudential returns;

and\n(e) a direction of the Regulatory Authority; and\n(f) a court order or decision to wind up or liquidate the group to\nwhich the firm belongs.\n10.1.2 Obligation of firm in run-off under FSR\nUnless the Regulatory Authority directs otherwise, a firm must\ncomply with this chapter if the firm is in run-off because of a decision\nor written notice of the authority, under the Financial Services\nRegulations, to the effect that the firm is to cease to effect contracts\nof insurance.\nV9 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 page 51\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Captive insurers in run-off\nPart 10.1 General provisions\nRule 10.1.3\n10.1.3 Contracts effected under existing term\n(1) In determining whether a firm is effecting contracts of insurance (or\nwhether a firm has ceased to effect contracts of insurance), contracts\nof insurance that are effected under a term of an existing contract must\nbe ignored unless the Regulatory Authority decides otherwise in\nrespect of a particular contract.\n(2) This rule applies whether the contracts of insurance are effected\nthrough a cell or long term insurance fund.\nGuidance\nThe effect of this rule is to disregard, for the purpose of determining whether this\nchapter applies, contracts of insurance that are effected by a firm because of a term\nof an existing contract of insurance. A contract will normally only be regarded as\nbeing effected under a term of an existing contract if—\n(a) the firm does not have discretion to decline to effect the new contract;\nor\n(b) it would be unreasonable for the firm, having regard to the interests of\nthe policyholder, to decline to effect the new contract.\npage 52 Captive Insurance Business Rules 2011 V9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCaptive

For example, CCPs typically require participants to provide\ncollateral (in the form of initial margin and other financial resources) to cover\ncurrent and potential future exposures.\nV3 Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023 page 7\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.2 Key concepts\nRule 1.2.5\n4 CCPs may also mutualise certain risks through devices such as default funds.\nAs a result of their potential to reduce risks to participants, CCPs can reduce\nsystemic risk in the markets they serve. The effectiveness of a CCP’s risk\ncontrols and the adequacy of its financial resources are critical to achieving\nthose benefits.\n1.2.5 Who are members of an authorised market entity?\n(1) Subject to subrule (2), a person who has been granted access to the\nfacilities of an authorised market entity in accordance with the\nentity’s rules is a member of the entity.\n(2) If a member of an authorised market entity allows a client to have\ndirect electronic access (for example, by allowing the client to use the\nmember’s trading code) to the entity’s trading facilities, that granting\nof access does not of itself make the client a member of the entity.\npage 8 Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023 V3\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nPrinciples of conduct Chapter 2\nRule 2.1.1\nChapter 2 Principles of conduct\n2.1.1 Application of principles\n(1) The principles in this Chapter apply to an authorised market entity in\nrelation to its conduct, in or from the QFC, of a regulated activity\nmentioned in rule 1.1.10.\n(2) The principles also apply to the activities of such an entity carried on\noutside the QFC, if the activities:\n(a) relate to 1 or more regulated activities carried on by the entity in\nor from the QFC; and\n(b) are capable of having an effect on any of the following:\n(i) confidence in the financial system operating in or from the\nQFC;\n(ii) the entity’s ability to comply with the requirements of\nthese rules as to financial resources;\n(iii) the entity’s fitness and propriety to be an authorised\nmarket entity.\n2.1.2 Principle 1 — integrity\nThe entity must observe high standards of integrity in the conduct of\nits business.\n2.1.3 Principle 2 — skill, care and diligence\nThe entity must act with due skill, care and diligence in the conduct\nof its business.\n2.1.4 Principle 3 — management\nThe entity must ensure that its affairs are managed effectively by its\nsenior management.\nV3 Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023 page 9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 2 Principles of conduct\nRule 2.1.5\n2.1.5 Principle 4 — systems and controls\nThe entity must have effective systems and controls, including risk\nmanagement systems and adequate human and technological\nresources.\n2.1.6 Principle 5 — financial prudence\nThe entity must maintain adequate financial resources.\n2.1.7 Principle 6 — market conduct\nThe entity must observe proper standards of market conduct.\n2.1.8 Principle 7 — regard to members’ interests\nThe entity must have due regard to its members’ interests and must\ntreat them fairly.\n2.1.9 Principle 8 — communications with members\nThe entity must pay due regard to the information needs of its\nmembers, and must communicate information to them in a way that\nis clear, fair and not misleading.\n2.1.10 Principle 9 — conflicts of interest\nThe entity must manage conflicts of interest fairly, both between itself\nand its members and between 1 member and another, and must\norganise its affairs in such a way that conflicts can be identified.\n2.1.11 Principle 10 — relationship of trust\nThe entity must faithfully discharge a responsibility of trust toward a\nmember. In doing so it must take reasonable care to ensure that its\nadvice and discretionary decisions are suitable for a member who is\nentitled to rely upon the entity’s judgment.\npage 10 Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023 V3\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nPrinciples of conduct Chapter 2\nRule 2.1.12\n2.1.12 Principle 11 — members’ assets\nThe entity must arrange adequate protections for its members’ assets\nwhen it is responsible for them in accordance with the responsibility\nit has accepted.\n2.1.13 Principle 12 — confidentiality\nThe entity must ensure that information of a confidential nature\nreceived in the course of dealings with its members is treated\nappropriately.\n2.1.14 Principle 13 — relations with regulators\nThe entity must deal with all relevant regulators in an open and\ncooperative way, and must keep the Regulatory Authority promptly\ninformed of anything that relates to the entity and about which the\nAuthority would reasonably expect to be informed.\nGuidance\n1 The principles in this Chapter are drawn up in accordance with FSR,\narticle 15 (3), and are part of these rules.\n2 The principles are a general statement of the standards expected of authorised\nmarket entities. They apply directly to the conduct of business, and the\noperation and financial standing, of such entities.\n3 The principles are not exhaustive of the standards expected. Complying with\nthe principles does not absolve such an entity from failing to observe other\nrequirements in these rules, and observing other applicable requirements in\nthese rules is not necessarily complying with the principles.\n4 Such an entity’s failure to comply adequately with the principles is likely to\naffect the Regulatory Authority’s assessment of the entity’s fitness and\npropriety. A breach of the principles could form the basis of action by the\nAuthority.\nV3 Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023 page 11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Authorisation — requirements and process\nRule 3.1.1\nChapter 3 Authorisation — requirements\nand process\n3.1.1 Relationship between Chapter 3 and FSR\nThe provisions of this Chapter are additional to the provisions of FSR,\nPart 5 (Authorisation requirements and process).\n3.1.2 Application of Chapter 3\nThis Chapter applies in relation to:\n(a) an application for an authorisation to conduct, in or from the\nQFC, either of the regulated activities mentioned in rule 1.1.10;\nand\n(b) an application for the variation or withdrawal of such an\nauthorisation.\nNote 1 An entity that is licensed (however described) by the Qatar Central Bank\nor the QFMA to conduct an activity in the State of Qatar outside the QFC\nis permitted (under certain conditions) to conduct that activity in or from\nthe QFC — see Chapter 10.

If the CCP calculates margins at more granular\nlevels, the initial margins must be applied to the corresponding\ndistribution of future exposures.\n(5) The initial margins must use models:\n(a) that rely on conservative estimates of the time horizons for\neffectively hedging or closing-out the particular types of\nderivatives that the CCP clears, even in stressed market\nconditions; and\n(b) that have an appropriate method for measuring credit exposure\nthat accounts for product risk factors and portfolio effects across\nproducts, and (so far as practicable and prudent) limits the need\nfor destabilising procyclical changes.\n(6) An authorised CCP may allow offsets or reductions in required\nmargin across products that it clears or between products that it and\nanother authorised CCP clear, if the risk of 1 product is significantly\nand reliably correlated with the risk of the other.\n(7) If 2 or more authorised CCPs are authorised to offer cross‐margining,\nthey must have appropriate safeguards and harmonised overall risk‐\nmanagement systems.\n9.3.12 Default fund\n(1) An authorised CCP must maintain a pre-funded default fund to cover\nlosses arising from the default of 1 or more clearing members that\nexceed the losses to be covered by margin requirements.

A clearing member’s contribution must be proportional\nto the CCP’s exposure to the member.\n(4) To ensure that its default fund is adequate to withstand any likely\ndefault, an authorised CCP must develop a range of possible future\nscenarios, including scenarios of extreme but plausible market\nconditions, and must test the fund’s adequacy under those scenarios.\nThe scenarios must take into account:\n(a) the most volatile periods that have been experienced in the\nmarkets for which the CCP provides its services; and\n(b) the possibility of sudden sales of financial resources and rapid\nreductions in market liquidity.\n(5) An authorised CCP may establish a separate default fund for each\ntype of derivative that it clears.\n9.3.13 Segregation and portability\n(1) An authorised CCP must have systems and procedures to enable the\nsegregation and portability of positions of its users’ customers, and\nany collateral provided to it in relation to those positions.\npage 168 Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023 V3\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperating obligations Chapter 9\nOperating obligations — authorised CCPs Part 9.3\nRule 9.3.13\n(2) The systems and controls must provide for the following:\n(a) segregation and portability arrangements that effectively protect\nthe positions and collateral of users’ customers from the default\nor insolvency of the relevant member or other users;\n(b) if the CCP offers additional protection of customers’ positions\nand collateral against the concurrent default of both the relevant\nmember and other users — any necessary measures to ensure\nthat the additional protection is effective;\n(c) account structures that enable the CCP to readily identify the\npositions of a user’s customers, and to segregate their collateral.\n(3) An authorised CCP must publish to its users its rules, policies and\nprocedures about the segregation and portability of positions and\ncollateral.\n(4) The requirement to distinguish assets and positions in accounts is\nsatisfied if:\n(a) the assets and positions are recorded in separate accounts;\n(b) netting between positions recorded in different accounts is\nprevented; and\n(c) the assets that cover the positions recorded in an account are not\nexposed to losses connected to positions recorded in another\naccount.\n(5) An authorised CCP must offer to keep:\n(a) records and accounts that enable users of its facilities to\ndistinguish the CCP’s assets and positions from those held for\nthe account of its clients (“omnibus client segregation”); or\n(b) records and accounts that enable users of its facilities to\ndistinguish assets and positions held for the account of a specific\nV3 Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023 page 169\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Operating obligations\nPart 9.3 Operating obligations — authorised CCPs\nRule 9.3.13\nclient from those held for the account of other clients\n(“individual client segregation”).\n(6) If a user so requests, an authorised CCP must offer the user the\npossibility of opening more accounts in the user’s own name or for\nthe account of their clients.\n(7) An authorised CCP must publish to the users of its facilities, its rules,\npolicies and procedures about the segregation and portability of the\npositions and related collateral of users’ clients facilities. The\npublication must disclose how to determine the value at which client\npositions will be transferred.\n(8) An authorised CCP must also disclose whether:\n(a) segregated assets and client collateral are held by the CCP or by\n1 or more unaffiliated third‐party custodians;\n(b) the CCP takes a title transfer or a security interest;\n(c) it has a right of use or re‐use of clients’ collateral and when;\n(d) clients’ collateral is protected on an individual or omnibus\naccount basis; and\n(e) there are any legal, operational or other constraints that would\nimpair its ability to segregate or transfer the positions (and\nrelated collateral) of a user’s clients.\n(9) An authorised CCP must structure its portability arrangements in a\nway that makes it highly likely that the positions and collateral of a\ndefaulting user’s customers will be transferred to 1 or more other\nusers.\npage 170 Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023 V3\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nEntities licensed etc by Qatar Central Bank or QFMA Chapter 10\nRule 10.1.1\nChapter 10 Entities licensed etc by Qatar\nCentral Bank or QFMA\n10.1.1 Application of Chapter 10\n(1) This Chapter applies to:\n(a) while a supervisory MoU is in effect between the Regulatory\nAuthority and the Qatar Central Bank — an entity that is\nlicensed (however described) by the Bank to conduct, in the\nState of Qatar outside the QFC, an activity that corresponds to a\nderivatives market activity;

The report will disclose an outstanding claim that will have a\nsignificant effect on the company’s financial results. A passes this information\non to family members who instruct their broker to sell their shares in the\ncompany. The Authority considers that the family members would have\ncontravened FSR, article 82 (1) (dealing on the basis of inside information),\nand A would have contravened FSR, article 82 (2) (disclosing inside\ninformation).\n2 B, an employee of an oil and gas company, knows through his employment\nthat the company is about to enter into a joint venture agreement with another\ncompany that could be very lucrative for his employer. Before the joint venture\nis disclosed to the market, B buys shares in his employer based on his\nexpectation that the price of the shares will rise significantly after the new joint\nventure is announced.\n3 C, an employee of a firm that is an advisor to a company, D, becomes aware\nof negotiations for a takeover of D that is likely to be announced to the market\nimminently.

Before\nexecuting the order, D trades for the firm and on her personal account by taking\na long position in those futures, based on her expectation that she will be able\nto sell them at a profit because of the significant price increase that will result\nfrom the execution of her client’s order. Both trades would contravene article\n82 (1) (dealing on the basis of inside information).\n4 Investment bank E has been in discussions with an issuer about a potential\nissue of new derivatives by the issuer. In order to gauge potential investor\ninterest and the terms of the issue, E raises the issue with a potential investor,\nF, to see if F would be prepared to commit to purchasing some of the\nderivatives. F uses this inside information to deal in related derivatives.\n13.3.3 Attempts to deal\n(1) An attempt to deal is to be regarded as contravening FSR,\narticle 82 (1) if the dealing, had it been completed, would have been\nregarded as contravening that article.\n(2) For subrule (1), a person has attempted to deal if the person takes a\nsubstantial step toward dealing but, for reasons that the person does\nnot intend, the dealing is not completed.\nGuidance\n“Attempting to deal” covers situations where a person who has inside information\ntakes steps to enter into a transaction but the transaction is not executed.

concerned is participating in a liquidity incentive\nscheme;\n(b) the person concerned reasonably believes that the relevant inside\ninformation has been disclosed to the market;\n(c) the relevant dealing occurs in the performance of an\nunderwriting agreement for the relevant derivative;\n(d) the dealing occurs in the performance of a person’s functions as\na liquidator or receiver; or\n(e) in the case of the execution, by a person who has inside\ninformation, of a client order — the person executes the order\nwithout giving the information to the client, or otherwise\nadvising or

the\nperson generally and continuously rather than for a particular\ntransaction, and the dealing is either of that kind, or is to hedge\na risk arising from such a dealing; and\n(b) inside information that is held by the person or persons who\nmake the decision to deal is limited to information about a\nperson’s pending orders.\n13.3.6 Execution of client orders\n(1) The execution by a person (person A) of an unsolicited client order\n(see subrule (2)) in a derivative while person A has inside information\nabout the derivative is not to be regarded as contravening FSR,\narticle 82 (1) if person A:\n(a) has not disclosed the inside information to the client nor\nprocured the client to deal in the derivative; and\n(b) has not otherwise advised or encouraged the client in relation

barriers\nA dealing by an entity is not to be regarded as contravening FSR,\narticle 82 (1) (even though the entity has, at the time, inside\ninformation relevant to the dealing) if:\n(a) at the time,

process or making it more\ndifficult to identify genuine orders on the trading system.\nGuidance\nAlthough some of the above paragraphs describe conduct that is more commonly\nassociated with algorithmic trading, such as high frequency trading, the\nRegulatory Authority considers that the conduct described could amount to\nabusive conduct even if carried out manually.\n(2) In considering whether particular conduct contravenes FSR,\narticle 82 (4) (A) by giving, or being likely to give a false or\nmisleading impression as to the supply of, demand for, or price of, a\nderivative, the Regulatory Authority may take into account the\nfollowing matters:\n(a) the extent to which orders to trade given, or transactions\nundertaken, represent a significant proportion of the daily\nvolume of transactions in the derivative on the market\nconcerned, and in particular whether those activities lead to a\nsignificant change in the price of the derivative;\nV3 Derivatives Markets and

made in a variety\nof ways — for example:\n• through a regulatory announcement service;\n• through media such as the radio, a newspaper or television;\n• through the internet, including social media;\n• through a market information service such as a trading terminal;\n• by telling another person orally.\n3 Examples of conduct that may contravene FSR, article 82 (6):\n• spreading a rumour, when the person doing so knew or ought to have known\nthat the rumour was false or misleading;\n• recklessly submitting false or misleading information about a derivative\nthrough a regulatory announcement service.\n13.7.1 Truth and falsity of statements for Part 13.7\n(1) For this Part, a statement is a false statement or a misleading\nstatement if it is objectively false or misleading, whether or not the\nperson who makes it:\n(a) knows it to be false or misleading; or\n(b) ought reasonably to have known that it is false or misleading\n(see subrule (3)).\n(2) For this Part, the

or\n(ii) is reckless or negligent as to whether making the statement\nmay induce another person to deal; and\n(b) another person’s dealing would be to person A’s advantage.\n(2) For subrule (1):\n(a) it is sufficient that the statement is made, and does not matter\nwho the statement is made to;\n(b) it is sufficient that person A’s intention is that some other person\ndeal (or that person A is reckless or negligent as to whether some\nother person may be induced to deal), and does not matter that\nperson A:\n(i) has no specific intention as to who must deal; or\n(ii) gives no thought as to who may be induced to deal; and\n(c) it does not matter that person A has no specific intention about\nwhich derivative must be dealt in, nor that any dealing that\npage 210 Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023 V3\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket abuse Chapter 13\nDisseminating false or misleading information Part 13.7\nRule 13.7.2\nresults is not in the derivative about which person A made the\nstatement.\nExamples of conduct that may contravene FSR, article 82:\n• a person (person A) circulates marketing information about a derivative to a\nsmall group of potential investors; the information includes exaggerated\nclaims about the potential future performance of the derivative when person A\nknows or ought to know that there is no reasonable basis for making the claims\n• a person (person C), a financial adviser who is managing investments for a\nclient, records false or misleading information about the value of investments\nin the client’s portfolio; person C’s purpose is to ensure that portfolio account\nstatements sent to the client show the value of the portfolio to be higher than\nits actual value, to induce the client to provide funds to buy further derivatives.\n(3) For this rule:\n(a) a person is negligent in relation to the effect of a statement if the\nperson gives no thought to the effect of the statement; and\n(b) a person is reckless in relation to the effect of a statement if the\nperson knows that the statement may have a particular effect but\nmakes the statement anyway.\nV3 Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023 page 211\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 14 Powers of Regulatory Authority\nPart 14.1 Supervisory powers\nRule 14.1.1\nChapter 14 Powers of Regulatory Authority\nPart 14.1 Supervisory powers\nNote for Part 14.1\nAn authorised market entity is an authorised firm (see rules 1.1.7 and 1.2.1).\nConsequently, the Regulatory Authority’s general powers under FSR in relation to\nauthorised firms and approved individuals apply in the same way as for any other\nauthorised firm.\n14.1.1 On-site inspections of authorised market entity\n(1) An authorised market entity must allow the Regulatory Authority\naccess to the entity’s premises:\n(a) to inspect documents;\n(b) to interview persons;\n(c) to ensure that the entity is complying with the legislation\napplicable in the QFC;

carried on\nby the firm in or from the QFC and are capable of having an effect on:\n(a) confidence in the financial system operating in or from the QFC;\n(b) the firm’s ability to comply with the Regulatory Authority’s\nrequirements as to financial resources; or\n(c) the firm’s fitness and propriety.\n(3) When the Regulatory Authority is considering the fitness and propriety\nof an authorised firm, it may take into account whether or not the other\nmembers of its group act in accordance with the principles in this Part.\n1.2.2 Principle 1—integrity\nAn authorised firm must observe high standards of integrity in the\nconduct of its business.\n1.2.3 Principle 2—skill, care and diligence\nAn authorised firm must act with due skill, care and diligence in the\nconduct of its

provisions Chapter 1\nPrinciples relating to the conduct, operation and financial standing of Part 1.2\nauthorised firms\nRule 1.2.8\n1.2.8 Principle 7—regard to customers’ interests\nAn authorised firm must have due regard to its customers’ interests and\nmust treat them fairly.\n1.2.9 Principle 8—communications with clients\nAn authorised firm must pay due regard to the information needs of its\nclients, and must communicate information to them in a way that is\nclear, fair and not misleading.\n1.2.10 Principle 9—conflicts of interest\nAn authorised firm must manage conflicts of interest fairly, both\nbetween itself and its customers and between 1 customer and another,\nand must organise its affairs in such a way that conflicts can be\nidentified.\n1.2.11 Principle 10—relationship of trust\nAn authorised firm must faithfully discharge a responsibility of trust\ntoward a customer. In doing so it must take reasonable care to ensure\nthe suitability of its advice and discretionary decisions for a customer\nwho is entitled to rely upon the firm’s judgment.\n1.2.12 Principle 11—customers’ assets\nAn authorised firm must arrange adequate protections for its customers’\nassets when it is responsible for them in accordance with the\nresponsibility it has accepted.\n1.2.13 Principle 12—confidentiality\nAn authorised firm must ensure that information of a confidential nature\nreceived in the course of dealings with its customers is treated in an\nappropriate manner.\n1.2.14 Principle 13—relations with regulators\nAn authorised firm must deal with all relevant regulators in an open and\ncooperative manner and must keep the Regulatory Authority promptly\ninformed of anything relating to the firm of which the authority would\nreasonably expect notice.\nGuidance\n1 The principles in this Part are drawn up in accordance with FSR, article 15 (3),\nand are part of these rules.\n2 The principles are a general statement of the standards expected of authorised\nfirms.

Complying with the\nprinciples does not absolve an authorised firm from failing to observe other\nrequirements in these rules, and observing other requirements in these rules is not\nnecessarily complying with the principles.\n4 An authorised firm’s failure to comply adequately with the principles is likely to\naffect the Regulatory Authority’s assessment of the firm’s fitness and propriety.\nA breach of the principles could form the basis of action by the authority.\npage 4 General Rules 2005 V29\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nFitness and propriety Chapter 2\nApplication Part 2.1\nRule 2.1.1\nChapter 2 Fitness and propriety\nPart 2.1 Application\n2.1.1 Application—Chapter 2\nThis Chapter applies to an applicant and an authorised firm.\nGuidance\n1 FSR, article 29 provides the Regulatory Authority with the power to make rules\nsetting out the criteria which an applicant must satisfy before authorisation can\nbe granted. FSR states that such criteria shall include the fitness and propriety,\nlegal form, resources, systems and controls and location of offices of an\napplicant.\n2 The purpose of fitness and propriety criteria is to set out the minimum criteria\nthat a person must meet for it to become and remain Authorised. It also enables\nthe Regulatory Authority to ensure that its regulation of authorised firms is not\nimpeded as a result of:\n(a) the authorised firm’s group structure or internal administration;\n(b) any other laws, regulations or administrative provisions of another\njurisdiction to which the authorised firm is subject; or\n(c) an inability or unwillingness to comply, on an ongoing basis with the\nrequirements imposed by the regulatory system.\n3 The fitness and propriety criteria summarises some of the areas that the\nRegulatory Authority will consider during the assessment of an applicant for\nauthorisation. Also, as part of its supervisory approach, the Regulatory Authority\nwill monitor whether an authorised firm continues to meet the fitness and\npropriety requirements. Under article 31, the Regulatory Authority may impose\nconditions or withdraw the authorised firm’s authorisation if it fails to satisfy the\ncriteria in article 29.\nV29 General Rules 2005 page

person\nappearing to be, or likely to be in a contractual relationship with\nthe applicant or authorised firm;\n(c) the nature of the regulated activities concerned;\n(d) whether the applicant’s or authorised firm’s affairs will be or are\nconducted and managed in a sound and prudent manner;\n(e) the location and jurisdiction of the applicant or authorised firm’s\nhead office and registered office and the location and jurisdiction\nof its parent entity;\n(f) the legal form that the applicant intends to adopt in light of the\nlocation of its offices and of the regulated activities concerned; and\n(g) any other relevant matters including those contained in Schedule 1.\nV29 General Rules 2005 page 7\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 2 Fitness and propriety\nRule 2.4.1\nPart 2.4

in\naccordance with Shari’a must state that fact in its application.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority may grant an authorisation as an Islamic\nfinancial institution only if the applicant’s

reporting Chapter 4A\nGeneral Part 4A.1\nRule 4A.1.1\nChapter 4A Protected reporting\nPart 4A.1 General\n4A.1.1 Introductory\nThis Chapter provides a framework for making confidential reports\nabout alleged wrongdoing by authorised firms or persons connected\nwith such firms. Protected reporting is often called whistleblowing. The\nmaker of such a report is often (but not necessarily) an employee of the\nfirm concerned.\n4A.1.2 Meaning of protected report and protected reporter\n(1) In this Chapter:\nprotected report means a report that meets all of the following\nrequirements:\n(a) it is made in good faith;\n(b) it is about an authorised firm or a person connected with such a\nfirm;\n(c) it is made to the firm itself or an authority or officer specified or\nreferred to in subrule (3);\n(d) if it is made to an authority or officer, the authority or officer is\nresponsible for matters of the kind reported;\n(e) it gives information that the reporter believes shows that any of the\nfollowing has happened, is happening, or is likely to happen:\n(i) a criminal offence (whether under the law of Qatar or of\nanother jurisdiction);\n(ii) a contravention of a relevant requirement, or a failure to\ncomply with a legal obligation of another kind;\nNote For contravention of a relevant requirement, see FSR,\narticle 84.\n(iii) the endangering of the health and safety of an individual;\n(iv) a breach of an authorised firm’s policies and procedures\n(including, for example, a breach of any code of conduct or\npolicy in relation to ethical behaviour);\n(v) the deliberate concealment of a matter referred to in any of\nsubparagraphs (i) to (iv).\nV29 General Rules 2005 page 15\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4A Protected reporting\nRule 4A.1.3\nprotected reporter means an individual who makes a protected report.\nGuidance\nNothing in this Chapter requires that a protected reporter be an employee of the\nauthorised firm about which the report is made.\n(2) For this Chapter, a report is made in good faith only if the individual\nwho made it believes on reasonable grounds that it is true.\n(3) For this Chapter, a report with the characteristics set out in the definition\nof protected report in subrule (1) is a protected report whether it is made\nto:\n(a) the authorised firm concerned;\n(b) the Regulatory Authority;\n(c) an officer of the State to whom crimes may be reported under Law\nNo. (23) of 2004, or whose responsibilities include the matters that\nare referred to in the report; or\n(d) a regulatory or governmental authority, body or agency in a\njurisdiction outside the QFC (whether in Qatar or not), including a\nbody or officeholder responsible for enforcing the criminal law of\nthe jurisdiction.\n4A.1.3 Reports to be treated as protected until contrary\nestablished\n(1) An authorised firm that receives a report that purports to be a protected\nreport:\n(a) must treat the individual who made the report as a protected\nreporter; and\n(b) must treat the report as a protected report;\nuntil the firm has decided, on the basis of a proper investigation, that the\nreport is not a protected report.\n(2) Subrule (3) applies if an authorised firm becomes aware that an\nindividual has made a report that purports to be a protected report about\nthe firm to an authority or officer specified or referred to in\nrule 4A.1.2 (3).\n(3) The firm must treat the individual as a protected reporter until the firm\nestablishes that the report is not a protected report.\npage 16 General Rules 2005 V29\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nProtected reporting Chapter 4A\nProtected reporting policies Part 4A.2\nRule 4A.2.1\nPart 4A.2 Protected reporting policies\n4A.2.1 Obligation to have protected reporting policy\n(1) An authorised firm must establish a written policy on protected\nreporting that:\n(a) is approved by the firm’s governing body;\n(b) complies with this Part; and\n(c) is appropriate for the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s\nbusiness.\n(2) An authorised firm that is a branch, or is a member of a corporate group,\nmay rely on the protected reporting policy of its head office, or a group-\nwide protected reporting policy, provided that the policy substantially\ncomplies with this Part.\n4A.2.2 Content of protected reporting policy\n(1) An authorised firm’s protected reporting policy must comply with all of\nthe following requirements:\n(a) it must provide 2 or more independent channels for making a\nprotected report;\nGuidance\nFor example, a firm’s policy could provide both a dedicated email address and\na dedicated telephone number to which reports can be made.\n(b) if appropriate, it must provide for such a report to be made in a\nlanguage other than English;\n(c) it must recognise that such a report could be made by anybody with\nthe necessary information (not only by an officer or employee);\n(d) it must allow a protected report to be made anonymously;\n(e) it must provide for the identity of a protected reporter to be kept\nconfidential (so far as possible);\nGuidance\nThe Regulatory Authority recognises that the investigation of a protected report\nmay reveal the identity of a protected reporter or make it possible to infer it.\n(f) it must provide for reasonable measures to protect a protected\nreporter, anyone who assists in investigating a protected report,\nand anyone who cooperates with the investigation, against\nretaliation;\n(g) it must explicitly recognise a protected reporter’s right (and, in\ncertain cases, obligation) to report to or communicate with the\nV29 General Rules 2005 page 17\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4A Protected reporting\nRule 4A.2.3\nRegulatory Authority, another regulator or an authority of the\nState;\nNote 1 Under the Criminal Procedures Code of the State (Law No. (23) of\n2004), article 32, a person who has knowledge of certain crimes must\nreport it to the State Prosecutor’s Office or a judicial commissioner.\nNote 2 For the firm’s obligation to cooperate with the Regulatory Authority,\nsee rule 1.2.14.\n(h) it must provide a suitable set of guiding principles, and clear\nprocedures, for the assessment, investigation and escalation of a\nprotected report;\n(i) it must provide for the investigation of a protected report to be\nindependent of the individual or business unit concerned;\nGuidance\nThis could include making arrangements for the investigation to be done by a\nthird party.\n(j) it must provide for a protected report to be acknowledged, and for\nthe protected reporter who made it to be kept informed (to the\nextent that is appropriate in the circumstances) about the progress\nand outcome of the investigation;\n(k) it must provide for the reporting, monitoring and investigation of\nretaliation, attempts at retaliation and threats of retaliation;\n(l) it must provide for retaliation, an attempt at retaliation, or a threat\nof retaliation to be treated as gross misconduct;\n(m) it must provide for appropriate reporting to the firm’s governing\nbody and the Regulatory Authority about protected reports, the\ninvestigation of such reports and the outcome of the investigations.\n(2) The firm must set out the policy clearly in a document, and must ensure\nthat all of the firm’s officers and employees have access to, and\nunderstand, the document.\n(3) The document must also clearly set out statements of:\n(a) the benefits to the firm of the protected reporting policy; and\n(b) the firm’s commitment to it.\n4A.2.3 Implementation of protected reporting policy\n(1) The senior management of an authorised firm must ensure that the\nfirm’s protected reporting policy is fully implemented.\n(2) In particular, the firm’s senior management must take reasonable steps\nto ensure that a protected reporter, anyone who assists in investigating\npage 18 General Rules 2005 V29\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nProtected reporting Chapter 4A\nProtected reporting policies Part 4A.2\nRule 4A.2.3\na protected report, and anyone who cooperates in the investigation, are\nprotected against retaliation.\nNote Under the Employment Regulations of the QFC, article 16, a person “…who\nin good faith raises concerns about or reports crimes, contraventions\n(including negligence, breach of contract, breach of law or requirements),\nmiscarriages of justice, dangers to health and safety or the environment and\nthe cover up of any of these by their Employer shall not be dismissed or\notherwise penalised directly or indirectly for such acts, including in respect\nof any prohibition against disclosure of non-public information.”.\nGuidance\n1 Retaliation or an attempt at retaliation against an employee who has made a report\nreferred to in the Employment Regulations, article 16, would therefore be a\ncontravention of a legal requirement (see rule 4A.1.1 (1), definition of protected\nreport, paragraph (e) (ii)), and could itself be the subject of a protected report.\n2 Also, see FSR, article 84 (1) (B)—retaliation against such an employee would\ncontravene article 16 of the Employment Regulations, thus is a contravention of\na relevant requirement, and could therefore give rise to disciplinary or\nenforcement action under FSR, Part 9.\n3 However, article 16 protects only employees; this Chapter requires anybody who\nmakes a protected report to be protected against retaliation.\n(3) An authorised firm must nominate an appropriately senior individual to\noversee the implementation of the firm’s protected reporting policy.\nGuidance\nThe individual nominated need not be an employee or even a board member, but could\nfor example be a legal adviser in an outside law firm.\n(4) An authorised firm that receives a protected report must notify the\nRegulatory Authority within 5 business days.\n(5) An authorised firm’s governing body must ensure that the firm’s\nprotected reporting policy is reviewed at least once every 3 years by:\n(a) the firm’s internal auditor;

Should an\nauthorised firm fail to pay by the due date then, without limiting the\nright of the Regulatory Authority to take any other action, the sum due\nwill be increased by 1% for each month, or part of a month, that it\nremains outstanding beyond the due date.\nGuidance\nIf a fee is not paid by the date on which it becomes due, the authorised firm is in breach\nof a rule and the Regulatory Authority is entitled to take action including, but not\nlimited to, taking steps to withdraw authorisation to conduct 1 or more regulated\nactivities.\n10.2.3 Regulatory Authority’s power to reduce or waive fees\nThe Regulatory Authority may reduce, waive or refund all or part of any\nfee if, having considered the circumstances of a particular case, it deems\nit would be equitable to do so.\nV29 General Rules 2005 page 73\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Fees\nRule 10.3.1\nPart 10.3 Supplementary fees\n10.3.1 Regulatory Authority may require supplementary fees in\ncertain cases\n(1) The Regulatory Authority may require an authorised firm or applicant\nto pay a supplementary fee to the Regulatory Authority in circumstances\nwhere it expects to incur substantial additional costs in dealing with an\napplication or conducting ongoing supervision.\n(2) In such cases the Regulatory Authority will notify the applicant as soon\nas reasonably practicable of the amount of the supplementary fee.\nGuidance\n1 A supplementary fee may be levied by the Regulatory Authority because it\nexpects that certain applications will require more intensive scrutiny than others.\nFor example, where the entity is a branch from a jurisdiction where there are not\nor are not expected to be in place arrangements for co-operation between the\nRegulatory Authority and the relevant regulators in that jurisdiction. Equally,\nwhere the entity is incorporated in the QFC, a full analysis of the prudential and\nsystems arrangements will be required.\n2 A supplementary fee may also be levied by the Regulatory Authority in cases\nwhere the ongoing supervision of the authorised firm appears to the Regulatory\nAuthority to be likely to cause it to incur substantial additional costs.\npage 74 General Rules 2005 V29\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nFees Chapter 10\nApplication fees Part 10.4\nRule 10.4.1\nPart 10.4 Application fees\n10.4.1 What application fees are payable\nAn applicant seeking to conduct regulated activities in or from the QFC\nand an authorised firm applying for authorisation to conduct additional\nregulated activities must pay to the Regulatory Authority:\n(a) the application fees specified in Schedule 4;

V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nKey concepts Part 1.2\nRule 1.2.1\nPart 1.2 Key concepts\nDivision 1.2.A Key concepts — corporate\ngovernance\n1.2.1 What is a firm’s governing body?\nFor these rules, an authorised firm’s governing body is:\n(a) in the case of a firm that is incorporated as a company or a\nlimited liability partnership in the QFC, or is a partnership\nconstituted under the Partnership Regulations 2007 — its board\nof directors or the body (whatever it is called) that, under the\nfirm’s constitutional document, has the responsibility of\noverseeing the firm’s business in or from the QFC; and\n(b) in the case of a firm that is a branch:\n(i) the firm’s board of directors, or a committee of that board,\nthat has the responsibility of overseeing the firm’s\nbusiness in or from the QFC; or\n(ii) that part of the firm’s committee of management or other\nbody (whatever it is called) that has the responsibility of\noverseeing the firm’s business in or from the QFC.\nGuidance\nThis definition draws a distinction (for some purposes) between:\n• a firm that is incorporated or formed in the QFC; and\n• a firm that is incorporated or formed outside the QFC (that is, a branch).\nIn the case of a branch, the firm’s board (wherever it is located) remains ultimately\nresponsible for the oversight of the firm, but many policy decisions may be made\nby a part, or a delegate, of the firm’s board. These rules recognise that firms choose\nto allocate their responsibilities and undertake their business in different ways;\nthese rules therefore place the responsibility for certain kinds of oversight on the\nfirm’s board or the part or delegate of the board.\n1.2.2 What is a firm’s corporate governance framework?\n(1) An authorised firm’s corporate governance framework is made up\nof the firm’s organisational structures, policies, procedures and\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 3\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.2 Key concepts\nRule 1.2.3\nsystems and controls as they relate to the firm’s business objectives\nand the means of achieving them.\n(2) An authorised firm’s corporate governance framework includes:\n(a) the firm’s risk management framework (see rule 1.2.3);\n(b) its internal control and assurance functions (that is, its risk\nmanagement, compliance oversight, internal audit and actuarial\nfunctions);\n(c) its business objectives; and\n(d) the corporate governance obligations in these rules, the\nCompanies Regulations, and other applicable regulations, rules\nand guidance.\nGuidance\n1 The corporate governance framework deals with the relationships between a\nfirm’s board, its senior management, depositors, policyholders, clients and\nother stakeholders. Other important aspects of corporate governance are the\nseparation of functions within the firm and the accountabilities for the internal\ncontrol and assurance functions.\n2 The corporate governance framework includes at least the firm’s objectives\nand the firm’s corporate governance obligations under these rules, the\nCompanies Regulations, and other regulations, rules and guidance.\n1.2.3 What is a firm’s risk management framework?\n(1) An authorised firm’s governing body must establish a risk\nmanagement framework.\nNote For the firm’s risk management framework, see rules 7.1.2 to 7.1.4.\n(2) The firm’s risk management framework is made up of:\n(a) the firm’s systems for identifying, measuring, evaluating,\nmonitoring, reporting, and controlling or mitigating material\nrisks that may affect the firm’s ability to meet its obligations;\nand\n(b) the structures, policies, processes and people that support those\nsystems.\npage 4 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nKey concepts Part 1.2\nRule 1.2.4\n1.2.4 What is a firm’s internal controls and assurance\nframework?\n(1) An authorised firm’s governing body must establish an internal\ncontrols and assurance framework made up of the firm’s internal\ncontrol and assurance functions.\nNote In relation to an authorised firm’s internal controls and assurance\nframework, see Chapter 6.\n(2) The following controlled functions are the internal control and\nassurance functions:\n(a) the risk management function (see rule 1.2.12);\n(b) the compliance oversight function (see rule 1.2.13);\n(c) the internal audit function (see rule 1.2.14);\n(d) the actuarial function (see rule 1.2.15).\n(3) The internal controls and assurance framework must provide\nreasonable assurance on the effectiveness and efficiency of the firm’s\noperations, the reliability of its financial reporting and the extent of\nits compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nDivision 1.2.B Key concepts—controlled functions\n1.2.5 What are controlled functions?\n(1) FSR, article 41, requires that, to exercise a controlled function for an\nauthorised firm, an individual must be an approved individual, and\nauthorises the Regulatory Authority to specify, in rules, the functions\nthat are controlled functions.\nNote The assessment, training and competency of individuals to exercise\ncontrolled functions is dealt with in INDI.\n(2) For FSR, article 41 (2), each of the following is a controlled function:\n(a) the non-executive governance function;\n(b) the executive governance function;\n(c) the senior executive function;\n(d) the finance function;\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 5\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.2 Key concepts\nRule 1.2.6\n(e) the senior management function;\n(f) the MLRO function;\n(g) the risk management function;\n(h) the compliance oversight function;\n(i) the internal audit function;\n(j) the actuarial function.\nNote 1 Each of the controlled functions mentioned in subrule (2) (other than the\nMLRO function) is described elsewhere in these rules.

A rolling\nplan supports a medium to long-term view of business objectives, while the annual\nreview ensures it is dynamic and updated to reflect current goals.\nThe Regulatory Authority expects that the firm would, as part of the business plan\nreview process, consider any impact it may have on the risk profile of the firm’s\noperations and identify potential changes to the material risks. This would\nordinarily include formal consideration of issues arising from planned material\nchanges to the firm’s operations and risks.\npage 18 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGoverning bodies Chapter 3\nGoverning bodies — all authorised firms Part 3.1\nRule 3.1.15\n3.1.15 Specific obligations — appointment etc of persons for\ncertain functions\n(1) A decision about the appointment, remuneration, disciplining or\ndismissal, or the assessment of the performance, of either of the\nfollowing individuals:\n(a) an individual who is approved to exercise the senior executive\nfunction for an authorised firm;\n(b) an authorised firm’s internal auditor;\nmay be made only by:\n(c) the firm’s governing body;\n(d) any relevant committee of the governing body;

or\n(c) failure to comply with, or the inadequate management of, legal or\nregulatory obligations.\n2 An authorised firm’s risk management policies and procedures should include\nprocesses for identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating legal risk. The\npolicies should include:\n(a) processes for identifying events that might generate legal risk (for\nexample, new products or processes, new documentation), the\nlikelihood of those events occurring and their consequences; and\n(b) procedures to ensure that:\n(i) all contractual, legal, regulatory and other documents are\naccurate and complete;\n(ii) the firm complies with all its legal, regulatory, contractual and\nprudential requirements and obligations; and\n(iii) all the firm’s insurances (for example, professional indemnity) are\nrenewed in good time and remain effective.\nNote For additional requirements on operational risk, see Chapter 8.\n(c) compliance, reputational and regulatory risk;\n(d) money laundering and terrorism financing risk; and\n(e) every other risk (whether singly or in combination with another\nrisk) that:\n(i) is material to the firm; or\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 65\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Risk management\nRule 7.1.1\n(ii) may have a material impact on the firm.\nExamples\ngroup risk\nclimate related risk\nGuidance\nFor a firm that is not a banking business firm, an Islamic banking business\nfirm, or a QFC insurer, the risks mentioned in subrule (2) may need to be\naddressed in the firm’s risk management framework if the risks are material\nto the firm or may have a material impact on the firm.\n(2) An authorised firm that is a banking business firm, an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm, or a QFC insurer (other than a QFC captive insurer)\nmust ensure that its risk management framework also addresses:\n(a) asset-liability management risk;\nGuidance\nAsset-liability management risk is the risk of an adverse movement in the\nrelative values of assets and liabilities of a bank or insurer due to changes in\ngeneral market factors, such as interest rates, inflation and, if relevant,\nforeign exchange rates.\n(b) concentration risk;\nGuidance\nConcentration risk is the risk of over-reliance on, or excessive exposure to,\na type of risk, counterparty, asset class, industry or region as a result of credit,\nbalance sheet and market, reserving, insurance, reinsurance, operational and\ngroup risks.\n(c) credit risk;\n(d) market and investment risk (including derivative risk);\n(e) market conduct risk; and\n(f) strategy and planning risk.\n(3) A QFC insurer (other than a QFC captive insurer) must ensure that its\nrisk management framework addresses, in addition to the risks in\nsubrules (1) and (2):\n(a) insurance risk;\n(b) reserving risk; and\npage 66 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nRisk management Chapter 7\nRule 7.1.1\n(c) reinsurance risk.\nGuidance\n1 Insurance risk is the risk that inadequate or inappropriate underwriting,\nclaims management, product design and pricing will expose an insurer to\nfinancial loss and the consequent inability to meet its liabilities.\n2 Reserving risk is the risk that the reserves set aside by the insurer for its\ninsurance liabilities (net of reinsurance and other recoveries for those\nliabilities) will be inadequate to meet the net amount payable when the\ninsurance liabilities crystallise.\n3 Reinsurance risk is the risk that the reinsurance cover obtained by the insurer\nis inadequate.\nNote PINS, Schedule 1 gives additional guidance on the above risks faced by\na QFC insurer. The Parts of Schedule 1 that are relevant are Part S1 credit\nrisk; Part S2 Balance sheet and market risk; Part S3 reserving risk; Part\nS4 insurance risk; Part S5 reinsurance risk; Part S7 concentration risk and\nPart S8 group risk.\n7.1.5 Risk appetite statement\n(1) An authorised firm must have a documented risk appetite statement.\nA risk appetite statement is a high-level statement that clearly\ncaptures the firm’s attitude to, and its level of acceptance of, the\nmaterial risks the firm is exposed to.\n(2) The firm’s risk appetite is the level of risk that the firm is willing to\nassume to achieve its strategic objectives and business plan.\nGuidance\nIn setting its risk appetite, the firm must take account of its prudential and other\nregulatory requirements.\n(3) The statement must, for each material risk, identify the maximum\nlevel of risk that the firm is willing to operate within, expressed as a\nrisk limit and based on its risk appetite, risk profile and capital\nstrength (risk tolerance).\nGuidance\nRisk tolerances are usually quantitative and support the translation of the risk\nappetite by senior management into operational limits for the day-to-day\nmanagement of material risks.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 67\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Risk management\nRule 7.1.1\n(4) The firm’s governing body must review and approve the statement\nannually.\nGuidance\n1 An authorised firm should consider using qualitative and quantitative\nmeasures in its statement as appropriate. The qualitative statement and\nquantitative measures referred to in this rule should reflect those expressed in\nthe firm’s risk management strategy (see rule 7.1.6 (2) (c)).\n2 For the purposes of setting risk tolerances, the firm may wish to utilise a\ntaxonomy that divides a material risk into more granular risks. For example, a\nfirm may wish to have specific risk tolerances for different risks that fall within\nthe broad definition of operational risk, such as ICT and information security\nrisks.\n7.1.6 Risk management strategy\n(1) An authorised firm’s risk management strategy must be appropriate\nto the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s business.\n(2) The strategy must:\n(a) identify each material risk to which the firm is exposed, and the\napproach to managing those risks;\n(b) clearly define and categorise material risks;\n(c) include both quantitative and qualitative considerations;\n(d) set out the approach to monitoring for significant changes to the\nfirm’s risk profile;\n(e) list and summarise the policies and procedures dealing with risk\nmanagement;\n(f) include objectives, principles and a well-defined, transparent\nand consistent allocation of responsibility for dealing with\nmaterial risks across the firm, including any branches;\n(g) include an assessment of whether the firm’s financial resources\nare adequate to address material risks, as well as an overview of\npage 68 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nRisk management Chapter 7\nRule 7.1.1\nthe mechanisms for monitoring, and ensuring compliance with,\nits capital requirements; and\nGuidance\nFor a banking business firm, an Islamic banking business firm, or a QFC\ninsurer this requirement can be addressed by referring to its ICAAP or\nORSA.\n(h) outline the firm’s approach:\n(i) to ensuring that all its staff have awareness of the risk\nmanagement framework as it relates to their role; and\n(ii) for establishing an appropriate risk culture across the firm.\n(3) The firm’s governing body must review and approve the strategy\nannually. The firm must have:\n(a) a process for obtaining and recording the governing body’s\napproval for a material change to, or deviation from, the\nstrategy; and\n(b) a process for obtaining a direction by the governing body\nsettling any major question about the interpretation of the\nstrategy.\n(4) The firm must ensure that the strategy is:\n(a) recorded in writing; and\n(b) kept up to date to take into account new internal and external\ncircumstances.\n(5) If the firm is part of a corporate group, the firm’s governing body\nmust know the implications for the firm of any group-wide risk\nmanagement strategy.\n(6) The firm must give to the Regulatory Authority a copy of its risk\nmanagement strategy, and any subsequent amended version of that\nstrategy, within 10 business days after its approval.\n7.1.7 Policies and procedures\n(1) An authorised firm’s risk management policies and procedures\nrequired under rule 7.1.6 (2) (e) must be appropriate to the nature,\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 69\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Risk management\nRule 7.1.1\nscale and complexity of the firm’s business and the risks to which it\nis exposed.\n(2) The policies and procedures must include processes for:\n(a) identifying and assessing material risks;\n(b) establishing, implementing and testing mitigation measures and\ncontrol mechanisms for material risks;\n(c) assessing risk positions, risk exposures, the steps being taken to\nmanage them and, if the firm’s risk profile changes, reviewing\nrisk limits;\n(d) reporting risk management information in both normal and\nstressed market conditions to the firm’s governing body and\nsenior management in a timely way, including escalation\nprocesses for reporting material events, issues and incidents;\n(e) establishing and maintaining appropriate contingency\narrangements (including robust and credible disaster recovery\nplans where warranted) to address risks that may materialise and\nactions to be taken, including in stressed conditions;\n(f) developing and maintaining effective risk management\ncommunication within the firm;\n(g) ensuring material risks are appropriately accounted for in the\nfirm’s internal pricing, performance measurement and new\nproduct approval processes for all significant business activities;\nand\n(h) reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the firm’s risk\nmanagement policies, procedures and controls, including the\ntriggers for commencing reviews.\n(3) A banking business firm or an Islamic banking business firm must\nensure that its policies and procedures also include a policy that\nspecifies the nature, role and extent of asset-liability management\nactivities and their relationship with the firm’s banking business\nmodel.\npage 70 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nRisk management Chapter 7\nRule 7.1.8\nNote A banking business firm, or an Islamic banking business firm, is also\nrequired to have policies and procedures in relation to certain material risks\nunder BANK or IBANK. Refer to BANK Part 1.2 and IBANK Part 1.2.\n(4) A QFC insurer (other than a QFC captive insurer) must ensure that its\npolicies and procedures also include:\n(a) a policy that specifies the nature, role and extent of asset-\nliability management activities and their relationship with\nproduct development, pricing and investment management;\n(b) a policy that specifies the nature, role and extent of the insurer’s\ninvestment activities (including credit exposures) and how the\ninsurer complies with regulatory requirements relating to\ninvestment;\n(c) a policy that specifies the risks to be accepted by the insurer as\npart of its insurance business, the processes for underwriting,\nproduct design, pricing and claims settlement and how the\npolicy interacts with the insurer’s reinsurance policy; and\n(d) a policy that sets out processes for ensuring that its reinsurance\narrangements are prudently and soundly managed, including\nthat any reinsurance contract to which the insurer is a party is\nfinalised and the material documents supporting the contract are\ncompleted:\n(i) before the start of reinsurance cover (the start date); or\n(ii) as soon as possible after the start date (but in no case later\nthan 60 days after the start date).\nNote The policies and procedures must deal with the risks faced by a\nQFC insurer. For guidance on what those risks might be, see PINS,\nSchedule 1, Parts S1 to S5, S7 and S8.\n7.1.8 Firms must provide appropriate training\n(1) The senior management of an authorised firm must ensure that\nappropriate risk management training is available to staff at all levels\nthroughout the firm. The training must be appropriate to the seniority,\nrole and responsibilities of staff.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 71\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Risk management\nRule 7.1.9\n(2) The senior management must ensure that staff:\n(a) have an awareness of the risk management framework as it\nrelates to their role; and\n(b) understand the material risks that the firm is exposed to;\nso that each member of staff can identify, assess, manage, and\nmitigate those risks effectively.\n7.1.9 Independence of certain employees\n(1) An authorised firm must ensure that each employee who is allocated\nresponsibilities within the firm’s risk management framework is\nsufficiently free from influence for the framework to be effective in\nachieving its purposes.\n(2) The requirement in subrule (1) is satisfied if reasonable measures\nhave been taken to ensure that:\n(a) no such employee is remunerated in a way that would tend to\nundermine his or her independence and objectivity in\nperforming the duties;\nNote For the requirements relating to a firm’s remuneration policy, see\nrule 3.1.16.\n(b) no such employee is involved in performing a function that\ngenerates, or is intended to generate, revenue for the firm;\n(c) no such employee is limited or restricted as to the matters that\nhe or she can investigate or report on in the exercise of his or her\nfunction;\n(d) the reports and conclusions of such an employee can be honest\nand candid, without fear of reprisal; and\n(e) pressure or influence is not applied to such an employee to\nmodify his or her reports or conclusions.\npage 72 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nGeneral Part 8.1\nRule 8.1.1\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nNotes for Chapter 8\n1 This Chapter expands the requirements addressed in general, and at a high\nlevel, in Chapter 7 as they relate to operational risk. The expanded provisions\nreflect:\n(a) the wide scope of operational risk;\n(b) the increasing complexity and interconnectivity of the business\nenvironment;\n(c) the growing dependence of firms on ICT, third parties and longer supply\nchains; and\n(d) the need for greater focus on operational resilience on the part of\nauthorised firms.\n2 This Chapter also sets out requirements for operational resilience, outsourcing,\nICT and information security risks, and business continuity.\nPart 8.1 General\n8.1.1 Application of Chapter 8\n(1) This Chapter applies to all authorised firms.\nGuidance\n1 An authorised firm should meet the requirements in Chapter 8 in a\nproportionate way. For example, firms with less complex operations (such as\none with lower reliance on third parties or ICT or with less sensitive\ninformation assets) may have simpler approaches to meeting them.\n2 Because of the principles-based approach adopted by the Regulatory\nAuthority, an authorised firm is allowed to determine how to meet the\nrequirements, depending on the nature, scale and complexity of its business.\nIn particular, each firm’s approach:\n(a) should reflect the assessment of its operational risk and operational\nresilience;\n(b) should be aligned to its corporate governance framework, risk appetite\nand risk management framework; and\n(c) should be reviewed and approved by the governing body.\n(2) If an authorised firm that is a branch or subsidiary considers it\nsuitable, the firm may rely on the policies, processes and procedures\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 73\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.1 General\nRule 8.1.2\nof its head office or parent entity to meet the requirements of this\nChapter.\n8.1.2 Risk event reporting\n(1) An authorised firm must give the Regulatory Authority written notice\nof an operational risk event or near miss that has, or could have had,\na material financial, business or reputational impact on the firm’s\noperations.\nExample\nA cyber-attack or similar incident.\n(2) The notice must be given within 1 business day after the event, near\nmiss, attack or incident occurs and must set out:\n(a) the nature and details of the event, near miss, attack or incident\nand its impact, or likely impact, on the firm’s operations;\n(b) the disruption (if any) to the firm’s operations; and\n(c) if disruption occurred, the action taken, and to be taken, by the\nfirm to return to normal operations, together with a timeframe\nfor doing so.\n(3) If the firm undertakes a root cause analysis of a disruption, it must\ngive the Authority an outline of the procedure and result of the\nanalysis and details of actions taken to prevent a reoccurrence. The\noutline and details must be given as soon as practicable after the\nanalysis.\npage 74 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOperational risk management Part 8.2\nRule 8.2.2\nPart 8.2 Operational risk management\n8.2.1 Definition of operational risk\n(1) Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from:\n(a) inadequate or failed internal processes or systems;\n(b) the inactions or actions of people; or\n(c) external drivers or events.\n(2) Operational risk is inherent in all products, activities, processes and\nsystems. It includes the risk of fraud, legal risk and ICT and\ninformation security risks but does not include strategic and\nreputational risks.\nNote Part 8.2 does not list specific risks that fall within the scope of operational\nrisk. An authorised firm should identify for itself those specific risks that\nare most relevant to its business.\n8.2.2 Obligations relating to operational risk\n(1) An authorised firm must identify, assess and manage operational risk.\nGuidance\n1 The identification and assessment of risks is fundamental to effective\noperational risk management. It directly contributes to the operational\nresilience of authorised firms.\n2 Effective risk identification considers both internal and external factors. Sound\nrisk assessment allows the firm to better understand its risk profile, allocate\nresources and implement strategies.\n3 This rule enhances rule 7.1.5. (3) on the requirement for an authorised firm to\nidentify the maximum level of risk (risk tolerance) based on its risk appetite,\nrisk profile and capital strength.\nExamples of tools to identify and assess operational risk\n• event management\n• operational risk event data gathering\n• self-assessments\n• control monitoring and assurance framework\n• metrics\n• scenario analysis\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 75\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.2 Operational risk management\nRule 8.2.2\n• benchmarking and comparative analysis\nNote For guidance on each of the above tools, see the Principles for the\nsound management of operational risk published by the BCBS, as\namended from time to time. See also guidance and principles of\nother standards-setting bodies such as IAIS and IOSCO regarding\nidentification and assessment of operational risk.\n(2) The firm must have a documented operational risk framework that is\nintegrated into its risk management framework. The firm must\ndevelop and implement:\n(a) governance arrangements for the oversight of operational risk\n(including reporting lines and roles and responsibilities);\n(b) monitoring, analysis and reporting of operational risk and\nescalation processes for operational risk events; and\n(c) internal controls that are designed and used effectively for the\nmanagement of operational risk.\nGuidance\nInternal controls should be designed to provide reasonable assurance that an\nauthorised firm will:\n(a) have efficient and effective operations;\n(b) safeguard its assets and adequately manage liabilities;\n(c) produce reliable financial reports; and\n(d) comply with its own policies and procedures and with applicable laws\nand regulations.\nExamples of controls\n• segregation of duties\n• dual controls\n• clearly established authorities or processes for approval\n• close monitoring of adherence to risk thresholds\n• safeguards for access to, and use of, assets and records\n• appropriate staffing and training to maintain technical expertise\n• ongoing processes to identify business units or products when returns appear\nto be out of line with reasonable expectations\npage 76 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOperational risk management Part 8.2\nRule 8.2.3\n• regular verification and reconciliation of transactions and accounts\nNote Under rule 7.1.4, operational risk is one of the risks that an authorised\nfirm’s risk management framework must address.\n8.2.3 Operational risk change management processes\n(1) An authorised firm’s operational risk framework must include a\nprocess for managing changes in its products, activities, systems,\nmarkets, locations and jurisdictions (OR change management\nprocess).\n(2) The firm’s OR change management process must:\n(a) include identifying, managing, challenging, approving, and\nmonitoring change on the basis of objective criteria;\n(b) ensure that operational risk arising from changes is promptly\nidentified, assessed and managed; and\n(c) be subject to independent and regular review and update.\nGuidance\n1 An authorised firm’s operational risk exposure generally evolves when the\nfirm initiates change by, for example:\n(a) engaging in a new activity;\n(b) developing a new service or product;\n(c) entering into an unfamiliar market or jurisdiction;\n(d) implementing new business processes or modifying them; or\n(e) engaging in a business that is geographically distant from its head office.\n2 As part of the general role and obligations of a firm’s governing body (as set\nout in Division 3.1.C of Chapter 3) the Regulatory Authority expects the\ngoverning body, or an appropriate committee of the governing body, to\napprove any changes that significantly affect the firm’s risk management\nprocess.\n3 Change management should assess the evolution of associated risks from start\nto finish (for example, throughout the full life cycle of a product).\n4 The firm’s OR change management process should be able to deal with\nchanges resulting from other sources of operational risk, such as those that\nmay arise from mergers and acquisitions, issues of corporate strategy, and\nmajor projects and investments.\nNote For management of changes in ICT systems, see Part 8.5.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 77\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.2 Operational risk management\nRule 8.2.4\n8.2.4 Operational risk reports\n(1) An authorised firm must, from time to time, prepare operational risk\nreports for the purposes of the monitoring, analysis and reporting\nrequired under rule 8.2.2 (2) (b). Each report:\n(a) must be comprehensive, accurate, consistent and actionable\nacross business units and products;\n(b) must be timely and capable of being produced in both normal\nand stressed market conditions;\n(c) must be manageable in scope and volume;\n(d) must give an outlook of the firm’s operational risk profile; and\n(e) must not impede decision-making by reason of excessive or\ninadequate data.\nGuidance\nThe frequency of reporting should reflect the risks that might arise, and the pace\nand nature of changes, in an authorised firm’s business. The results of monitoring\nshould be included in regular reports to the firm’s governing body and senior\nmanagement, as should any assessments of its operational risk framework and\noperational resilience approach.\n(2) An operational risk report must describe the firm’s operational risk\nprofile by providing internal financial, operational and compliance\nindicators, together with external market or environmental\ninformation about events and conditions that are relevant to decision\nmaking.\n(3) The following must be included in the report:\n(a) breaches of the firm’s risk appetite and risk tolerance for\noperational risk (including details of action taken, or planned, to\nmitigate the effect of any such breaches);\n(b) a discussion and assessment of key and emerging risks;\n(c) details of recent significant internal operational risk events and\nlosses (including root-cause analysis); and\npage 78 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOperational risk management Part 8.2\nRule 8.2.4\n(d) relevant external events or regulatory changes and their potential\nimpact on the firm.\nGuidance\nUnder this rule, the reports received by the governing body of an authorised firm\nmay include reports on ICT and information security risks, major ICT projects and\nsignificant security breaches, as required by rule 8.5.2 (1) (f). Alternatively, the\ngoverning body may receive a separate report on those matters.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 79\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.3 Operational resilience\nRule 8.3.2\nPart 8.3 Operational resilience\nNotes for Part 8.3\n1 This Part assumes that, from time to time, disruptions will prevent an\nauthorised firm from operating as usual and see the firm unable to provide its\nservices for a period. It therefore sets out requirements relating to the\noperational resilience of the firm’s critical operations.\n2 The requirements address the growing risks to operational resilience from the\ninterconnectedness of the financial system and the complex and dynamic\nenvironment in which a firm operates.\n8.3.1 Application of Part 8.3\nThis Part does not apply to a captive insurer.\n8.3.2 When is an operation critical and what is operational\nresilience?\n(1) An operation is critical if it is a service, product or function identified\nby an authorised firm as one which, if disrupted, is likely to have a\nsignificant impact on the firm, its customers or its role in the financial\nsystem.\n(2) Operational resilience, of an authorised firm, is the ability of the firm\nto deliver critical operations in the event of a disruption. It includes\nthe ability of the firm to prevent, adapt to, respond to, recover from,\nand learn from operational disruption.\nGuidance\n1 Operational resilience requires an authorised firm to look at, from end-to-end,\neach of the activities required to deliver a particular operation. This differs\nfrom the more traditional focus of business continuity management on\nprotecting individual systems, processes and functions.\n2 The firm’s ICT policies, processes and procedures should identify the ICT\ndependencies for its critical operations.\npage 80 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOperational resilience Part 8.3\nRule 8.3.4\n8.3.3 Approach to operational resilience\n(1) An authorised firm must align its operational resilience approach to\nits corporate governance framework and operational risk framework.\nGuidance\nAs part of its approach to operational resilience, an authorised firm should:\n(a) leverage change management capabilities in accordance with its\nOR change management process as a way to assess potential effects on\nthe delivery of critical operations and on their interconnections and\ninterdependencies; and\n(b) ensure its existing corporate governance framework and committee\nstructures include responsibilities for operational resilience.\nNote The governing body of an authorised firm is responsible for overseeing\nan effective approach to the firm’s operational resilience (see\nrule 3.1.17).\n(2) The firm must have sound, effective and comprehensive processes\nand systems to enable it to comply with its obligations under this Part.\n8.3.4 Obligations relating to critical operations\n(1) An authorised firm must identify its critical operations and determine\nthe systems, infrastructure and resources needed to support each\noperation.\n(2) In identifying critical operations, the firm must consider:\n(a) the impact a disruption would pose to the firm and its customers;\n(b) the soundness of the firm and its ability to continue operating;\nand\n(c) the firm’s role in the financial system.\n(3) The governing body must review and approve all operations\nidentified as critical at least once a year.\nGuidance\n1 Because business differs from firm to firm, an authorised firm should take an\noutcomes-based approach in identifying critical operations. The firm’s critical\noperations will usually be a short list of services, products or functions, for\nwhich the firm has chosen to build high levels of operational resilience in\nanticipation of disruption.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 81\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.3 Operational resilience\nRule 8.3.5\n2 The firm should consider whether the number of critical operations is\nappropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its business. It should also\nconsider the practicalities of identifying critical operations, so that:\n(a) the firm’s governing body and senior management can prioritise the\noperations and make investment decisions; and\n(b) the impact tolerance set for an operation can be applied to, and tested\non, the operation.\nExamples of operations\n• payments\n• deposit-taking and management\n• custody\n• settlements\n• clearing\n• claims processing\n• customer enquiries\n8.3.5 Impact tolerance\n(1) Impact tolerance, in relation to a critical operation, is the maximum\ntolerable level of disruption at which any further disruption to the\noperation:\n(a) will have a significant impact on the soundness of the firm or its\nability to continue operating; or\n(b) will cause significant adverse impact on an authorised firm’s\ncustomers; or\n(c) will pose a risk to the soundness, stability or resilience of the\nfinancial system or to the orderly operation of the financial\nmarkets.\n(2) An impact tolerance must have a clear metric identifying the\nmaximum level of disruption the firm is willing to tolerate in relation\nto the critical operation. At a minimum, there must be a time-based\npage 82 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOperational resilience Part 8.3\nRule 8.3.5\nmetric indicating the maximum acceptable period a critical operation\ncan withstand a disruption.\nGuidance\n1 A time-based metric ensures that an authorised firm focuses its response to a\ndisruption on the continuity of its critical operations. To be prepared to\nwithstand more than one type of disruption, an authorised firm should consider\nhaving additional impact tolerance metrics that are, for example, based on:\n(a) the maximum acceptable number of customers effected by a disruption;\n(b) the maximum number of transactions affected by a disruption;\n(c) the maximum extent of data loss the firm would tolerate as a result of a\ndisruption; or\n(d) the maximum value of transactions impacted.\n2 Impact tolerance metrics should be clear and measurable and can be both\nqualitative and quantitative. They should refer to specific outcomes and\nmeasurements, so that the firm can determine the outcome if the impact\ntolerances are exceeded.\n3 While impact tolerances should be aligned to an authorised firm’s risk\nappetite, they are separate and distinct measurements. Risk appetite and risk\ntolerances focus on the impact and probability of a risk event occurring and\nare typically set with references to the firm’s strategic and business plans.\n4 The Regulatory Authority’s expectation is that impact tolerances will be set\non assumptions that severe but plausible disruptions will occur. The firm\nshould not consider the cause or probability of disruption when setting their\nimpact tolerances.\n5 Impact tolerances should be used as a planning tool for the firm (rather than\nas a tool to measure regulatory compliance) to enable the firm to understand\nits level of operational resilience in the event of a disruption.\n6 In setting impact tolerances, the firm may leverage any appropriate pre-\ndetermined and approved criteria used as part of other practices. For example,\nthese may include processes used for business impact analysis (BIA), recovery\ntime objectives (RTOs), recovery point objectives (RPOs) and maximum\ntolerable outage (MTO) where these metrics that measure disruption of single\npoints of failure feed into the delivery of a critical operation.\n(3) An authorised firm must set, in relation to each critical operation, an\nimpact tolerance that has been approved by the firm’s governing\nbody.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 83\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.3 Operational resilience\nRule 8.3.6\n(4) The firm must ensure that it can remain below its impact tolerance for\neach critical operation in the event of a severe but plausible\ndisruption.\n(5) Subrule (4) has effect on and after 1 October 2026.\n8.3.6 Resources and processes for critical operations\n(1) An authorised firm must identify the resources and processes needed\nto deliver each critical operation.\n(2) Identifying the resources and processes needed to deliver a critical\noperation, includes:\n(a) identifying:\n(i) resources (including financial and human resources, ICT\nand other information assets);\n(ii) key steps in business activities and processes; and\n(iii) organisational structures;\nneeded to deliver the operation;\n(b) setting out interdependencies across the matters identified under\nparagraph (a); and\n(c) identifying risks, obligations, key data and controls associated\nwith delivering the operation.\nGuidance\n1 An authorised firm should determine the appropriate methodology and\nassumptions for identifying the resources and processes needed to deliver\ncritical operations that best fit its business, depending on its nature, scale and\ncomplexity.\n2 Identification should be conducted with a level of detail that enables the firm\nto:\n(a) identify resources that contribute to the delivery of each stage of the\noperation, and their importance;\n(b) ascertain whether the resources are fit for purpose;\n(c) consider what would happen if resources were to become unavailable;\n(d) identify vulnerabilities and key dependencies; and\npage 84 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOperational resilience Part 8.3\nRule 8.3.7\n(e) test the firm’s ability to deliver critical operations while remaining\nbelow the impact tolerances.\n3 The firm should ensure that when identifying the resources and processes\nneeded to deliver critical operations, the firm takes account of dependencies\non outsourcing. Particular care should be taken in maintaining updated details\nof information assets.\n8.3.7 Testing impact tolerances\n(1) The firm must periodically test its ability to remain below its impact\ntolerances and carry on critical operations in the event of a severe but\nplausible disruption (scenario testing). In conducting scenario\ntesting, the firm must:\n(a) identify a range of adverse circumstances of varying nature,\nseverity and duration relevant to its business and operational risk\nprofile; and\n(c) consider the risks to delivery of the firm’s critical operations in\nthose circumstances.\n(2) The governing body of the firm must review the results of all scenario\ntesting of critical operations.\n(3) If scenario testing identifies a situation where impact tolerances may\nbe breached:\n(a) the firm must assess whether the test has identified weaknesses\nor vulnerabilities that require the firm to develop and implement\na remediation plan to ensure that the firm can remain below its\nimpact tolerances;\n(b) the governing body must approve any remediation plan required\nto be developed under paragraph (a) and review its\nimplementation; and\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 85\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.3 Operational resilience\nRule 8.3.8\n(c) the senior management and governing body may take any other\naction to improve the resilience of the firm’s critical operations\nand focus investment where needed.\nGuidance\n1 To design scenarios and understand their full implication, the firm should\nconsider previous breaches or near misses within the firm, across the financial\nsector, and in other sectors and jurisdictions.\n2 Impact tolerance assumes a disruption has occurred, and so testing the ability\nto remain below impact tolerances should not focus on preventing risk events\nfrom occurring. Rather, the Regulatory Authority expects the firm to focus on\nresponse and recovery.\n3 The type, extent and frequency of testing should be appropriate to the nature,\nscale and complexity of the firm’s business. The firm should also consider\ntesting if there is a material change to its business, critical operations or impact\ntolerances. The firm may choose to conduct this testing alongside its BCP\ntesting.\n4 A scenario test should identify any vulnerabilities or reliance on third parties.\nTesting should evolve as the firm learns from previous testing.\n5 If a particular scenario causes the firm to exceed an impact tolerance and the\ngoverning body and senior management consider this is tolerable, they will\nneed to be able to explain their reasoning to the Authority.\n8.3.8 Incident management, response and recovery\n(1) An authorised firm must develop and implement response and\ndisaster recovery plans and procedures to manage incidents that\ndisrupt, or that may potentially disrupt, the firm’s critical operations.\nThe plans must be in writing, integrated into the firm’s operational\nrisk framework and aligned to the firm’s operational resilience\napproach, risk appetite and impact tolerances.\n(2) To enhance the firm’s ability to adapt and respond to future incidents,\na lessons-learned exercise must be conducted after a disruption to a\ncritical operation.\n(3) After each lessons-learned exercise is conducted, the firm must make\nthe necessary improvements to address identified weaknesses or\nvulnerabilities to ensure that it can remain below its impact tolerance\nfor each critical operation in the event of a severe but plausible\ndisruption.\npage 86 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOperational resilience Part 8.3\nRule 8.3.8\n(4) Root causes of disruptions must be identified and managed to prevent\nor minimise serial recurrence. The firm must maintain an inventory\nof:\n(a) incident response and recovery;\n(b) internal and third-party resources to support the firm’s response;\n(c) recovery capabilities; and\n(d) communication plans to report incidents to both internal and\nexternal stakeholders.\n(5) Incident management, response and recovery procedures should be\nreviewed and tested periodically.\nGuidance\n1 Operational resilience requires an authorised firm to have an approach that\ncovers the full life cycle of an incident, from the classification of incidents that\ntrigger approved response and recovery procedures through to reflecting on\nlessons learned.\n2 The incident management plan must consider how a disruption resulting from\nan incident can affect the firm’s risk appetite and impact tolerances.\n3 Lessons learned from previous incidents, including incidents experienced by\nothers, should be reflected when updating the incident management, response\nand disaster recovery plans and procedures.\n4 The connections of the firm’s incident management and response plans to its\nBCP and disaster recovery plans should be clear.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 87\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.4 Outsourcing arrangements\nRule 8.4.1\nPart 8.4 Outsourcing arrangements\n8.4.1 Application of Part 8.4\nThis Part does not apply to the outsourcing of a function by an\nauthorised firm if the function is outsourced by the firm under COLL\nor CAPI.\nNote 1 This Part, however, applies to outsourcing by an authorised firm to which\nPROF applies.\nNote 2 Each of COLL and CAPI contains separate outsourcing rules for the\noutsourcing of functions by authorised firms to which those rules apply.\nGuidance\n1 Financial services firms increasingly rely on service providers to support their\noperations. Firms look to external providers to perform not only functions,\nservices or activities that would normally be performed in-house (that is,\noutsourcing) but also for new services, capabilities and expertise that extend\nits offerings to the market.\n2 The expanded use of service providers gives rise to longer and more complex\nsupply chains, often involving a reliance on fourth parties and other\ndownstream providers.\n3 While the requirements of this Part only apply to outsourcing arrangements, an\nauthorised firm should consider applying the policies and controls mentioned\nin this Part to any third-party arrangement that could pose risks to the firm.\n8.4.2 Meaning of outsourcing and material outsourcing\n(1) In these rules:\nmaterial outsourcing arrangement, for an authorised firm, means an\narrangement, entered into in accordance with rule 8.4.6, that is of such\nimportance that weakness or failure in the performance of the\nfunction, service or activity would cast serious doubt on:\n(a) the firm’s ability to comply with:\n(i) any regulations, rules or principles; or\n(ii) any condition, restriction or requirement of its\nauthorisation;\n(b) its financial performance or position; or\npage 88 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOutsourcing arrangements Part 8.4\nRule 8.4.3\n(c) the continuity of any of its critical operations.\nNote See Part 8.3 on the requirement to identify critical operations.\noutsourcing, for an authorised firm, means an arrangement between\nthe firm and a separate service provider (including a member of the\nfirm’s corporate group) by which the service provider performs a\nfunction, service or activity that would normally be performed by the\nfirm.\n(2) For the purposes of this Part, the following do not constitute\noutsourcing:\n(a) an arrangement to provide advisory services (such as the\nprovision of legal advice), audit services, personnel training\nservices, billing services, and physical security;\n(b) a supply arrangement (including the supply of electricity or\nwater and the provision of catering and cleaning services);\n(c) the purchase of standardised services (such as market\ninformation services and the provision of prices); and\n(d) the appointment of a group employee to perform a controlled\nfunction for the firm.\nNote For provisions about the appointment of a group employee to\nperform a controlled function, see INDI, Part 3.2.\n8.4.3 Responsibility for outsourced functions, services or\nactivities\n(1) The outsourcing of a function, service or activity by an authorised\nfirm does not relieve the firm’s governing body from any obligation\nin relation to the function, service or activity under the law applicable\nin the QFC.\n(2) The governing body remains responsible for ensuring:\n(a) that all requirements are complied with in relation to the\nfunction, service or activity; and\n(b) that the function, service or activity is otherwise properly\nperformed.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 89\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.4 Outsourcing arrangements\nRule 8.4.4\n(3) The governing body must exercise due skill, care and diligence in\ncarrying out its obligations in relation to an outsourced function,\nservice or activity that is performed under an outsourcing\narrangement.\n8.4.4 Obligation to have outsourcing policy\n(1) An authorised firm must have a policy for managing material\noutsourcing arrangements (outsourcing policy). The firm’s\ngoverning body must approve the policy.\n(2) The policy must at least provide for:\n(a) how the firm determines whether an arrangement relating to the\nperformance of a function, service or activity is material to the\nfirm;\n(b) the firm’s approach to entering into, managing, monitoring,\nsubstituting and exiting material arrangements;\n(c) the firm’s approach to managing the risks associated with\nmaterial arrangements;\n(d) clear accountability and roles and responsibility for entering\ninto, monitoring and managing material arrangements; and\n(e) the firm’s risk appetite and risk tolerance for outsourcing.\n(3) A policy that the firm will not enter into any material outsourcing\narrangements is taken to satisfy subrule (1).\n(4) The governing body must review, at least once in every 2 years, the\nfirm’s outsourcing policy and procedures, including:\n(a) its procedures for:\n(i) assessing the feasibility of a proposed material outsourcing\narrangement and the risks that the arrangement poses to\nthe firm’s business; and\n(ii) costing any such proposal; and\n(b) the criteria for selecting service providers.\npage 90 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOutsourcing arrangements Part 8.4\nRule 8.4.5\n8.4.5 Due skill in material outsourcing arrangements\n(1) The senior management of an authorised firm must exercise due skill,\ncare and diligence in selecting, entering into, managing and exiting\nfrom a material outsourcing arrangement.\n(2) Before entering into a material outsourcing arrangement, the senior\nmanagement:\n(a) must assess the risks that the arrangement poses to the firm’s\nbusiness; and\n(b) must satisfy themselves that the service provider selected has the\nability and capacity to perform the relevant function, service or\nactivity reliably and professionally at the start and throughout\nthe life cycle of the arrangement.\n(3) For this rule, the senior management must take into account at least\nthe following matters:\n(a) whether the service provider is regulated, to what extent, and by\nwhom;\n(b) whether the function, service or activity is subject to specific\nregulation or supervision;\n(c) the risk that the service provider’s service may become\nunavailable because of the number of other persons using the\nservice provider;\n(d) any potential impacts on the firm’s level of operational risk;\n(e) any potential impacts on the operational resilience of the firm\nthat the arrangement may give rise to (including the firm’s\nability to remain below its impact tolerances);\n(e) the financial stability and expertise of the service provider; and\n(f) any conflict of interest that might arise from the provision of the\nfunction, service or activity by the service provider.\nGuidance\n1 Outsourcing can expose an authorised firm to heightened operational risk\n(particularly ICT and information security risks). Before entering into an\noutsourcing arrangement, and throughout the life cycle of the arrangement, the\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 91\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.4 Outsourcing arrangements\nRule 8.4.6\nfirm should conduct risk assessments and due diligence to consider whether\nthe arrangement:\n(a) is aligned to the firm’s risk appetite, ICT strategy and approach to\noperational resilience; and\n(b) is integrated into the firm’s operational risk framework.\n2 The firm should be satisfied that the service provider (and any other party\nsubcontracted to provide the service) has sufficient resources, skills and\ncontrols. This could be achieved through a combination of interviews, service\nreporting, control testing, certifications, attestations, referrals and independent\nassurance assessments.\n3 The firm should be able to demonstrate that the systems and controls of service\nproviders in relation to information security are at least as strong as the firm’s\nown.\n4 The senior management of the firm should consider the service provider’s\ncapacity to provide functions, services or activities necessary to the firm’s\ncritical operations in the event of a disruption. The senior management should\nexamine the provider’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans\n(including the quality of such plans and the frequency and results of their\ntesting by the service provider).\n5 Operational risk may be heighted because of increased concentration risks\nfrom:\n(a) outsourcing to a dominant service provider that is not easily\nsubstitutable; and\n(b) multiple outsourcing arrangements with the same service provider or\nclosely connected service providers.\n8.4.6 Entering material outsourcing arrangements\n(1) An authorised firm may enter into a material outsourcing arrangement\nonly if:\n(a) the firm’s governing body has approved the firm’s outsourcing\npolicy; and\n(b) the arrangement:\n(i) is permitted by the policy;\n(ii) will not reduce the firm’s ability to fulfil its obligations to\ndepositors, policyholders, clients and other stakeholders;\npage 92 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOutsourcing arrangements Part 8.4\nRule 8.4.6\n(iii) will not increase the firm’s risk of non-compliance with\nthe law applicable in the QFC or any other applicable law;\n(iv) will not affect the Regulatory Authority’s ability to\nappropriately supervise the firm; and\nExample for paragraph (b) (iv)\nThe place where the service provider is located, or that place’s legal\nsystem, could prevent the Authority from appropriately supervising\nthe firm.\n(v) will not weaken the firm’s ability to deliver critical\noperations in the event of a disruption.\n(2) The material outsourcing arrangement must be in writing. It must be\nlegally binding and require the service provider to:\n(a) deal with the Regulatory Authority in an open and co-operative\nway in relation to matters relating to the firm under the\narrangement; and\n(b) grant the Authority access to the firm’s books, records and data\nin the possession or control of the service provider.\nGuidance\nThe Regulatory Authority expects an authorised firm to be able to demonstrate that\nthe outsourced function, service or activity is being effectively performed by the\nservice provider. The Authority may seek documentary evidence relating to the\nservice provider’s performance.\n(3) If appropriate, the agreement must include provisions on:\n(a) the law applicable to the agreement;\n(b) the reporting or notification requirements on the service\nprovider;\n(c) the means for measuring quantitative and qualitative\nperformance by the service provider;\n(d) access by the firm, its internal auditors, external auditors or\nactuaries to the firm’s books, records and data while they are in\nthe possession or control of the service provider;\n(e) the obligation to protect confidential information and personal\ndata (that is, any information relating to an individual who can\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 93\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.4 Outsourcing arrangements\nRule 8.4.6\nbe identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to\nan identification number or to 1 or more factors specific to the\nindividual’s physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural\nor social identity);\n(f) the rules for subcontracting, if the arrangement permits it;\n(g) the termination rights of each party; and\n(h) contingency arrangements.\nNote Rule 8.4.11 requires contingency arrangements to be made to allow the\nfirm’s business to continue in the event of a significant loss of services\nfrom the service provider.\n(4) If the authorised firm is a category A firm, the written agreement must\nrequire the service provider to grant the Authority access to the\nprovider’s premises (but see subrule (7)).\n(5) The agreement must include the requirement that the service provider\ngrants the Authority access to the provider’s premises if:\n(a) the authorised firm is a category B firm; and\n(b) the Regulatory Authority directs the firm to include that\nrequirement in the agreement.\nGuidance\nThe Regulatory Authority would normally assess whether to issue a direction under\nsubrule (5) (b) during the 30-business day notification period that firms must\nprovide the Authority prior to entering into or amending an arrangement (see\nrules 8.4.7 (1) and 8.4.8 (1). But if the Authority thinks it is necessary or appropriate\nto do so, it may give the direction at a later time.\n(6) To avoid doubt, the requirement to notify the Regulatory Authority\nof an amendment to an outsourcing agreement under rule 8.4.8, does\nnot apply if the Authority directs the firm to amend the agreement\nunder subrule (5) (b).\n(7) A written agreement entered into by a category A firm before\n1 October 2025 must be amended to include the requirement in\nsubrule (4) no later than 30 September 2026.\n(8) The firm must maintain an up-to-date register of material outsourcing\narrangements.\npage 94 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOutsourcing arrangements Part 8.4\nRule 8.4.7\nGuidance\nThe register should, at a minimum, include:\n(a) a brief description of each arrangement and the service provider;\n(b) a list of critical subcontracting parties (if any) to each arrangement;\n(c) a statement whether the firm is sharing confidential, personal, regulatory\nor otherwise sensitive data with the service provider and, if so, who is\nprocessing that data, where and how.\n(9) The register must be provided to the Regulatory Authority annually\nand at any other time as the Authority may direct.\nGuidance\nClear and consistent identification of material outsourcing arrangements can\nsupport an authorised firm in effectively monitoring and managing third-party risks.\nIt can also provide to financial regulators useful data to identify possible\nconcentration risks from outsourcing arrangements that may pose systemic risks.\n8.4.7 Regulatory Authority to be notified of certain matters\n(1) Other than cases where the Regulatory Authority must give prior\npermission for a material outsourcing arrangement, an authorised\nfirm must not enter a material outsourcing arrangement unless it gives\nthe Regulatory Authority written notice of its intention to enter into\nthe arrangement at least 30 business days before it enters into the\narrangement.\n(2) If a material outsourcing arrangement (including one which requires\nthe Regulatory Authority’s prior permission) permits subcontracting\nto another third party, the firm must give the Authority notice of that\nfact.\nNote For the requirement to obtain the Regulatory Authority’s permission\nbefore outsourcing certain controlled functions, see for example:\n(a) rule 4.1.5 on the outsourcing of the finance function by authorised\nfirms other than banking business firms, Islamic banking business\nfirms and QFC insurers (except QFC captive insurers);\n(b) rule 6.3.2 on the outsourcing of the compliance oversight function\nby authorised firms other than banking business firms, Islamic\nbanking business firms and QFC insurers (except QFC captive\ninsurers); and\n(c) rule 6.4.2 on the outsourcing of the internal audit function by QFC\ninsurers (except QFC captive insurers).\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 95\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.4 Outsourcing arrangements\nRule 8.4.8\n8.4.8 Amendments to material outsourcing arrangement\n(1) Other than cases where the Regulatory Authority must give prior\npermission for a material outsourcing arrangement, an authorised\nfirm must not amend a material outsourcing arrangement unless it\ngives the Regulatory Authority written notice of the amendment at\nleast 30 business days before the amendment takes effect.\n(2) If a material outsourcing arrangement is one which requires the prior\npermission of the Regulatory Authority, an authorised firm must not\namend the arrangement unless it has the Authority’s permission to do\nso.\n8.4.9 Review of outsourcing of controlled functions\n(1) This rule applies if an authorised firm outsources a controlled\nfunction to a third party.\n(2) The outsourcing of a controlled function is taken to be a material\noutsourcing arrangement.\n(3) The senior management of the firm must:\n(a) review each such arrangement annually to ensure that the\nindependence, objectivity and effectiveness of the performance\nof the function are not adversely affected; and\n(b) report the results of the review to the firm’s governing body.\nNote The appointment of a group employee to perform a controlled function\nfor the firm does not, of its own, constitute a material outsourcing\narrangement, see rule 8.4.2 (2) (d).\n8.4.10 Additional information about material outsourcing\narrangements\n(1) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice to an authorised\nfirm, require the firm to give the Authority, within a stated reasonable\nperiod, information about a material outsourcing arrangement (or\nproposed material outsourcing arrangement) that the Authority\nreasonably needs to enable it to decide whether the arrangement\ncomplies with this Part.\npage 96 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nOutsourcing arrangements Part 8.4\nRule 8.4.11\n(2) The power given by this rule is additional to the Authority’s other\npowers.\nNote See for example FSR, article 48 (powers to obtain documents and\ninformation).\n8.4.11 Contingency arrangements\n(1) An authorised firm that enters into a material outsourcing\narrangement must make comprehensive contingency arrangements to\nallow its business to continue in the event of a significant loss of\nservices from the service provider.\n(2) The contingency arrangements must include:\n(a) an exit strategy; and\n(b) if appropriate, provision for partial exit and step-in.\n(3) The contingency arrangements must, at a minimum, cover scenarios\ninvolving:\n(a) a significant loss of resources at the service provider;\n(b) the financial failure of the service provider;\n(c) an unexpected termination of the outsourcing arrangement;\n(d) the service provider posing ICT and information security risks\noutside of the firm’s risk appetite;\n(e) the service provider posing risks that weaken the firm’s ability\nto remain below its impact tolerances; and\n(e) the Regulatory Authority being unable to effectively supervise\nthe firm because of the conditions or circumstances of the\nmaterial outsourcing arrangement.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 97\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.5 ICT and information security risks\nRule 8.5.1\nPart 8.5 ICT and information security\nrisks\nNote for Part 8.5\nThe purpose of this Part is to enhance aspects of the operational risk framework and\noperational resilience approach that apply to ICT and information security risks.\nThis Part should be applied proportionately to the nature, scale and technological\ncomplexity of an authorised firm’s business and the sensitivity and value of its\ninformation assets.\n8.5.1 Definition of ICT and information security risks\n(1) ICT (or Information and communication technology) and\ninformation security risks means the risks of loss arising from:\n(a) breach of confidentiality;\n(b) failure of integrity of systems and data;\n(c) inappropriateness or unavailability of systems and data; or\n(d) inability to change ICT within a reasonable period and with\nreasonable costs when the environment or business\nrequirements change.\n(2) ICT and information security risks include risks arising from\ninadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from\nexternal events (such as cyber-attacks) and inadequate physical\nsecurity.\n8.5.2 ICT and information security policies, etc\n(1) An authorised firm must ensure its operational risk framework\nincludes policies, processes and procedures for managing ICT and\ninformation security risks, in particular to:\n(a) determine risk tolerances for ICT and information security risks,\nin accordance with the risk appetite of the firm;\n(b) identify and assess the ICT and information security risks to\nwhich the firm is exposed, including those associated with\nlegacy ICT assets;\npage 98 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nICT and information security risks Part 8.5\nRule 8.5.2\n(c) maintain an up-to-date ICT and information security risks\nregister;\nGuidance\nThe register should include, in relation to each risk recorded, the kind of risk,\nrisk owner, materiality of the risk, controls applied to the risk and whether\nany residual risk remains after controls have been applied.\n(d) implement mitigation measures consistent with assessed risks;\n(e) monitor the effectiveness of mitigation measures (including\nthrough regular testing), as well as the number of reported\nincidents, and take action to correct the measures where\nnecessary;\n(f) report to the governing body on the ICT and information\nsecurity risks and controls; and\n(g) identify and assess whether there are ICT and information\nsecurity risks arising from any major change in ICT systems or\nICT services, processes or procedures, or after any significant\nsecurity breach.\nGuidance\n1 The ICT and information security policies, processes and procedures should\nbe appropriately informed by relevant industry, national and international\nstandards and guidelines. Regular reviews should assess the completeness of\nthe policies, processes and procedures against those standards and guidelines,\nagainst best practice and against evolving threats and evolving or new\ntechnologies.\n2 Robust oversight and engagement on ICT matters by an authorised firm’s\ngoverning body and senior management play a leading role in promoting an\nICT and information security risks-conscious culture within the firm. To\nensure this, the governing body and senior management should possess\nsufficient knowledge and understanding of the ICT and information security\nrisks facing the firm and take steps so that these risks are well understood and\nproperly managed throughout the firm.\n3 The firm should clearly define and allocate to a sufficiently senior position\nwithin the firm, roles and responsibilities in managing ICT and information\nsecurity risks (including in emergency or crisis decision-making). The roles\nand responsibilities should be documented and communicated to relevant\nstaff.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 99\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.5 ICT and information security risks\nRule 8.5.2\n4 Because roles and responsibilities for ICT and information security are often\nlocated across business areas and functions, the firm should avoid unclear\naccountabilities, lack of ownership and ineffective oversight and prevent\nfragmented practices.\n5 For larger and more complex firms, consideration should be given to allocating\nresponsibility for managing and overseeing ICT and information security to a\ncontrolled function.\n6 An authorised firm should consider gaining assurance of the effectiveness of\nits governance and control frameworks for ICT and information security risks,\neither through audit reviews by its internal audit function (if this function has\nsufficient knowledge, skills and expertise in ICT and information security\nrisks) or by independent experts. The frequency and focus of such audits\nshould be commensurate with the relevant ICT and information security risks.\n7 Depending on the nature, scale and technological complexity of an authorised\nfirm’s business, the firm’s ICT policies, processes and procedures should:\n(a) maintain an up-to-date inventory of information assets (including\nconfiguration of those assets and the links and interconnections between\ndifferent assets to enable proper configuration and change\nmanagement);\n(b) monitor and manage the life cycles of ICT assets to ensure they meet\nand support business and risk management requirements;\n(c) carry on performance and capacity planning to prevent, detect and\nrespond to important performance issues in ICT systems and services,\nand in capacity shortages, in a timely manner;\n(d) set up data and ICT systems backup and restoration procedures to ensure\nthat they can be recovered as required; and\n(e) manage incidents and problems to monitor and log operational risk\nevents and security ICT incidents and to enable the firm to continue or\nresume, in a timely manner, critical operations when disruptions occur.\n8 The scope and frequency of data and ICT systems backup and restoration\nprocedures in guidance 7 (d) should be:\n(a) set in line with business recovery requirements and the criticality of the\ndata and the ICT systems; and\n(b) evaluated according to the current risk assessment.\n9 Incident and problem management in guidance 7 (e) should include:\n(a) procedures to identify, track, log, categorise and classify incidents\naccording to criticality;\n(b) the roles and responsibilities for different incident scenarios (for\nexample, errors, malfunctioning, cyber-attacks);\npage 100 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nICT and information security risks Part 8.5\nRule 8.5.3\n(c) problem management procedures to identify, analyse and solve the root\ncause behind one or more incidents;\n(d) effective internal communication plans, including incident notification\nand escalation processes (including for security-related customer\ncomplaints);\n(e) incident response procedures to mitigate the impacts related to the\nincidents and to ensure that the service becomes operational and secure\nin a timely manner; and\n(f) for critical operations, specific external communication plans.\n10 Effective internal communication plans in guidance 9 (d) should ensure that:\n(a) incidents with a potentially high adverse impact on critical operations\nare reported to the relevant senior management; and\n(b) the governing body is informed on an ad-hoc basis in the event of\nsignificant incidents and, at least, informed of the impact, the response\nand the additional controls to be defined as a result of the incidents.\n11 The specific external communication plans for critical operations in\nguidance 9 (f) are required in order:\n(a) to collaborate with relevant stakeholders to effectively respond to and\nrecover from the incident; and\n(b) to provide timely information to external parties (for example,\ncustomers, other market participants, the Regulatory Authority, other\nState agencies) as appropriate and in line with any applicable regulatory\nrequirements.\n(2) The ICT and information security policies, processes and procedures\nof an authorised firm must be aligned to its operational resilience\napproach to ensure the effective and prudent management of ICT and\ninformation security risks.\n8.5.3 ICT strategy\nThe firm must have a written ICT strategy that is aligned to its\nbusiness strategy.\nGuidance\n1 For most authorised firms, ICT is a core enabler of the business with most, if\nnot all, of the critical operations and systems supported by ICT. It is important\nthat an authorised firm has an ICT strategy that is comprehensive and aligned\nto its business strategy so that it can deliver on objectives to support the current\nand future strategic direction of the firm.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 101\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.5 ICT and information security risks\nRule 8.5.4\n2 An authorised firm’s ICT strategy should address:\n(a) how the firm’s ICT should evolve to effectively support and participate\nin its business strategy, including the evolution of the organisational\nstructure, ICT system changes and key dependencies (including third\nparties);\n(b) the planned strategy and evolution of the architecture of ICT; and\n(c) clear information security objectives, focusing on ICT systems,\nservices, staff and processes.\n3 The governing body should ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to\nimplement the ICT strategy, including an adequate ICT budget, staff levels\nand expertise.\n4 There should be clear roles and responsibilities for implementing, managing\nand overseeing the effectiveness of the ICT strategy. This is particularly\nimportant for ICT and information security risks since roles and\nresponsibilities are often located or spread across business areas and functions\n5 There should also be plans to identify and address any resourcing and\ncapability gaps that could obstruct the achievement of the wider strategic\nobjectives, including those relating to the execution of change management on\na present and forward-looking basis.\n6 An authorised firm that is part of a group should ensure that any group-driven\nICT strategies and governance arrangements are appropriately tailored from a\nregulatory and operational perspective for the firm.\n8.5.4 Project and change management processes\n(1) An authorised firm must have:\n(a) a process for managing projects relating to ICT and information\nsecurity (ICT project management process); and\n(b) a process for managing changes relating to ICT and information\nsecurity (ICT change management process).\n(2) The firm’s ICT project management process must include:\n(a) project objectives;\n(b) project risk assessments;\n(c) project plans, timeframes and steps; and\n(d) key milestones.\npage 102 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nICT and information security risks Part 8.5\nRule 8.5.5\n(3) The firm’s ICT change management process must:\n(a) include identifying, managing, challenging, approving and\nmonitoring change on the basis of objective criteria; and\n(b) ensure that ICT and information security risks arising from new\nor modified products, activities, processes and systems are\npromptly identified, assessed and managed.\n(4) The firm’s ICT project and change management processes:\n(a) must include sufficient testing and consideration of security\nrequirements in all stages of system or product design,\ndevelopment and testing;\n(b) must ensure that they effectively address ICT and information\nsecurity risks associated with the upgrade or the development or\nacquisition and implementation of new ICT systems or software;\nand\n(c) must be subject to independent and regular review and update.\n8.5.5 Information security policy\n(1) An authorised firm must have an information security policy setting\nout the high-level principles to protect the confidentiality, integrity\nand availability of data and information belonging to the firm or its\ncustomers.\n(2) The firm’s information security policy must:\n(a) include a description of the main roles and responsibilities of\ninformation security management;\n(b) set out how the firm identifies and classifies its information\nassets (including those managed by third parties) by criticality\nand sensitivity;\nGuidance\nCriticality refers to the potential impact of a loss of availability while\nsensitivity refers to the potential impact of a loss of confidentiality or\nintegrity.\n(c) set out the requirements for staff and contractors, processes and\ntechnology in relation to information security, recognising that\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 103\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.5 ICT and information security risks\nRule 8.5.5\nstaff and contractors at all levels have responsibilities in\nensuring the firm’s information security; and\n(d) be communicated to all staff and contractors of the firm.\n(3) The firm must ensure it mitigates the ICT and information security\nrisks that it is exposed to and that could impact its ability to meet its\ninformation security policy. The mitigation must be commensurate\nwith:\n(a) vulnerabilities and threats to the data assets;\n(b) the criticality and sensitivity of the data assets;\n(c) the stage at which the data assets are within their life cycle; and\n(d) the potential consequences of an information security breach.\nGuidance\n1 Depending on the nature, scale, technological complexity of an authorised\nfirm’s business and the criticality and sensitivity of its information and data\nassets, the firm’s mitigation measures should include:\n(a) procedures for logical access control (that is, identity and access\nmanagement);\nExample of techniques for access control\n• user accountability\n• need to know, least privilege and segregation of duties\n• privileged access rights\n• logging of user activities\n• access management and rectification\n• authentication methods\n(b) physical security measures to protect the firm’s premises, data centres\nand sensitive areas from unauthorised access and from environmental\nhazards;\n(c) ICT security procedures to prevent the occurrence of security issues in\nICT systems and services and minimise their impact on ICT service\ndelivery;\nExamples of security procedures\n• identification of potential vulnerabilities, which should be\nevaluated and remediated by ensuring that software and firmware\nare up to date (including the software provided by

8\nBusiness continuity Part 8.6\nRule 8.6.1\nPart 8.6 Business continuity\n8.6.1 Definition of business continuity plan\nThe business continuity plan (BCP), of an authorised firm, is a\ncomprehensive plan of action, prepared in accordance with rule 8.6.2,\nthat sets out the processes and procedures necessary to continue or\nrestore the operation of the firm in the event of a disruption.\nNote Rule 8.6.3 requires an authorised firm’s governing body to approve the\nfirm’s BCP.\n8.6.2 Obligations relating to BCP\n(1) An authorised firm must have a robust BCP.\nGuidance for all authorised firms\nThe firm may have more than one BCP and a BCP may include separate crisis\nmanagement plans and disaster recovery plans.\n(2) The BCP must include processes and procedures necessary to keep\nits critical operations below the firm’s impact tolerances through\nsevere but plausible disruptions.\nGuidance\n1 BCPs have traditionally focused on single points of failure (such as individual\nsystems, people or processes). For subrule (2), an authorised firm is expected\nto have processes and procedures:\n(a) to ensure that its BCP addresses wider operational resilience objectives;\nand\n(b) to determine points of failure that have the potential to affect the end-\nto-end delivery of its critical operations.\n2 Tools such as business impact analysis (BIA) and testing undertaken for the\nBCP of the firm would likely inform, or be run alongside, the mapping of its\ncritical operations, development of response and disaster recovery plans and\nprocedures, and testing of its ability to remain below its identified impact\ntolerances through severe but plausible scenarios.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 107\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Operational risk and resilience\nPart 8.6 Business continuity\nRule 8.6.3\n(3) The firm’s BCP must be in writing and integrated into its operational\nrisk framework and aligned to its operational resilience approach. It\nmust, at a minimum, include:\n(a) triggers to identify a disruption and prompt activation of the\nBCP, and arrangements to direct resources in the event of\nactivation;\n(b) roles and responsibilities for managing operational disruptions,\nwith clear guidance on the succession of authority in the event\nof a disruption impacting key personnel;\n(c) actions it would take to recover and restore operations in the\nevent of disruption and maintain critical operations within its\nimpact tolerances;\n(d) an assessment of the execution risks, required resources and\npreparatory measures, including key internal and external\ndependencies, needed to support the implementation of the\nBCP; and\n(e) a communications strategy to support implementation of the\nBCP.\nGuidance\nThis rule does not preclude an authorised firm from using metrics targeting more\nspecific BCP objectives (such as recovery time objectives for critical operations\nand systems), as well as other forms of BCP testing (such as basic call-cascade tests,\ncrisis management exercises or data restoration testing).\n(4) The firm must develop and implement a training programme to\nensure all staff who have a role in the firm’s BCP are familiar with\ntheir roles and responsibilities. The firm must ensure that all staff\nhave an appropriate awareness of the firm’s BCP.\n8.6.3 Approval, review and testing of BCP\n(1) The governing body of an authorised firm must approve the firm’s\nBCP.\n(2) The governing body must ensure that the firm’s BCP is periodically\nreviewed and tested. The governing body must keep the plan under\npage 108 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk and resilience Chapter 8\nBusiness continuity Part 8.6\nRule 8.6.3\nreview and must ensure that it is tested at intervals determined by the\nbody.\n(3) The governing body must ensure that the firm’s BCP is reviewed:\n(a) annually by the firm’s internal audit function or an independent\nexternal reviewer; and\n(b) every 3 years by an independent external reviewer.\nGuidance\nIf the same external reviewer is conducting both the 3-year review and the annual\nreview in the third year, they may be conducted as a single process. In this case,\nthe Regulatory Authority would not require separate reviews and reports to be\nprovided to a firm’s governing body and senior management in the third year.\n(4) The 3-year review:\n(a) must take account of any tests and changes to the BCP in the 3\nyears; and\n(b) may form part of a review carried out under rule 3.1.19 by an\nindependent external reviewer.\n(5) The interval between tests must be appropriate to the nature, scale and\ncomplexity of the firm’s business but must not be longer than\n18 months. The Regulatory Authority may direct the firm to test the\nplan at any time and in a way that the Authority considers appropriate.\n(6) The BCP must be updated as a result of reviews and tests to address\nidentified shortcomings or reflect changes (for example, to the firm’s\nlegal or organisational structure, business mix, strategy or risk\nprofile).\n(7) Results from reviews and tests of the BCP must be reported to the\ngoverning body and senior management.\nV03 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 page 109\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Islamic financial institutions\nPart 9.1 Preliminary\nRule 9.1.1\nChapter 9 Islamic financial institutions\nPart 9.1 Preliminary\n9.1.1 Application of Chapter 9\nThis Chapter applies to all Islamic financial institutions.\n9.1.2 Definitions for Chapter 9\nIn this Chapter:\nAAOIFI means the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for\nIslamic Financial Institutions.\nIslamic financial business means the business of carrying on 1 or\nmore regulated activities in accordance with Shari’a.\npage 110 Governance and Controlled Functions Rules 2020 V03\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nIslamic financial institutions Chapter 9\nPolicies, procedures, systems and controls Part 9.2\nRule 9.2.1\nPart 9.2 Policies, procedures, systems\nand controls\n9.2.1 Policies — compliance with Shari’a\nAn Islamic financial institution must establish and implement policies\nto ensure that its business is conducted in accordance with Shari’a.\nThe policies must include effective and comprehensive procedures to\nensure that the firm complies with:\n(a) Shari’a (in general and in relation to the requirements for Islamic\nfinancial contracts); and\n(b) the fatwas, rulings and guidelines issued by its Shari’a\nsupervisory board.\n9.2.2 Policy and procedures manual for Islamic financial\nbusiness\nAn Islamic financial institution must establish, implement and\nmaintain a policy and procedures manual for Islamic financial\nbusiness.

Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation,\nsupervision and practices of banks and regulators worldwide and thereby\nenhance financial stability.\n1.1.2 Commencement\nThese rules commence on 1 January 2016.\n1.1.3 Effect of definitions, notes, examples and references\n(1) A definition in Part 2 of the glossary at the back of these rules also\napplies to any instructions or document made under these rules.

No other firm may conduct Islamic\nbanking business.\n(2) A firm is an Islamic bank even if it is also authorised to conduct any\nother activity that is not Islamic banking business. An authorised firm\ndoes not cease to be an Islamic bank only because it conducts other\nactivities (such as Islamic investment business and associated\nbusiness) included in its authorisation, provided the firm conducts\nthem in accordance with Shari’a.\n1.1.8 Islamic investment dealer\n(1) An authorised firm is an Islamic investment dealer if it is an Islamic\nfinancial institution:\n(a) that is authorised to conduct the regulated activity of Islamic\ninvestment business; but\n(b) is not an Islamic bank.\n(2) A firm is an Islamic investment dealer even if it is also authorised to\nconduct any other activity that is not Islamic investment business. An\nauthorised firm does not cease to be an Islamic investment dealer only\nbecause it conducts other activities in its authorisation, provided the\nfirm conducts them in accordance with Shari’a.\n1.1.9 Islamic banking business firm\nIn these rules, Islamic banking business firm means an Islamic bank\nor Islamic investment dealer.\nGuidance\nAn Islamic banking business firm will need to consider the extent to which its\nbusiness model is subject to the prudential requirements set out in these rules. These\nrules are designed to address the different risks that could arise from the broad range\nof activities, business models, risk appetites and risk profiles of Islamic banking\nbusiness firms.\npage 4 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nPreliminary Part 1.1\nRule 1.1.10\n1.1.10 Legal form that Islamic banking business firms must take\n(1) An Islamic bank must be:\n(a) a limited liability company incorporated under the Companies\nRegulations 2005; or\n(b) a branch that is registered with the QFC Companies Registration\nOffice and that complies with subrule (3).\n(2) An Islamic investment dealer must be:\n(a) a limited liability company incorporated under the Companies\nRegulations 2005;\n(b) a limited liability partnership incorporated under the Limited\nLiability Partnerships Regulations 2005; or\n(c) a branch that is registered with the QFC Companies Registration\nOffice and that complies with subrule (3).\n(3) For a branch to be an Islamic banking business firm, the legal person\nof which it is a branch must itself conduct the whole of its business in\naccordance with Shari’a. Islamic banking business and Islamic\ninvestment business must not be conducted by means of an Islamic\nwindow.\nNote If an authorised firm conducts a part (but not the whole) of its business in\naccordance with Shari’a, the part so conducted is an Islamic window.\n(4) The Regulatory Authority will not grant an authorisation to conduct\nIslamic banking business or Islamic investment business unless:\n(a) the applicant states in its application for the authorisation that it\nproposes to conduct its business in accordance with Shari’a; and\n(b) the applicant’s constitutional documents require it to conduct its\nbusiness in accordance with Shari’a.\n(5) If the Regulatory Authority grants an authorisation to conduct Islamic\nbanking business or Islamic investment business, the authority must\nimpose on the authorisation a condition that the business must be\nconducted in accordance with Shari’a.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 5\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.1 Preliminary\nRule 1.1.11\n1.1.11 Application of these rules—general\nExcept as stated otherwise, these rules apply to an entity that has, or\nis applying for, an authorisation to conduct Islamic banking business\nor Islamic investment business.\nGuidance\n1 Rules that are of general application also apply (for example, CIPR, CTRL\nand AML/CFTR).\n2 It is possible for a firm both to be authorised as an Islamic bank under these\nrules and to hold an authorisation under INMA. Both these rules and INMA\nwould apply to such a firm to some degree. In relation to such a firm, however,\nthe capital requirements in these rules apply. If that firm complies with the\ncapital requirements in these rules, it is taken to comply with the minimum\ncapital and liquid assets requirements in INMA—see INMA, rule 3.3.1(2).\n1.1.12 Application of these rules—branches\n(1) Chapter 3 (capital adequacy and capital requirements) does not apply\nto an Islamic banking business firm that is a branch insofar as that\nChapter would require the branch to hold capital.\n(2) However, the Regulatory Authority may require a branch to have\ncapital resources or to comply with any other capital requirement if\nthe authority considers it necessary or desirable to do so in the interest\nof effective supervision of the branch.\n1.1.13 Requirement for policy also requires procedures and\nsystems\nIn these rules, a requirement for an Islamic banking business firm to\nhave a policy also requires the firm to have the procedures, systems,\nprocesses, controls and limits needed to give effect to the policy.\n1.1.14 Responsibility for principles\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s governing body is responsible for\nthe firm’s compliance with the principles and requirements set out in\nthese rules.\n(2) The governing body must ensure that the firm’s senior management\nestablishes and implements policies to give effect to these rules.

The interval between reviews must be appropriate\nfor the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s business, but must\nnot be longer than 12 months.\n(4) The governing body must ensure that the policies are made known to,\nand understood by, all relevant staff.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 7\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.2 Principles relating to Islamic banking business and Islamic\ninvestment business\nRule 1.2.1\nPart 1.2 Principles relating to Islamic\nbanking business and Islamic\ninvestment business\n1.2.1 Principle 1—capital adequacy\nAn Islamic banking business firm must have capital, of adequate\namount and appropriate quality, for the nature, scale and complexity\nof its business and for its risk profile.\n1.2.2 Principle 2—credit risk and problem assets\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must have an adequate credit risk\nmanagement policy that takes into account the firm’s risk appetite, its\nrisk profile and the market and macroeconomic conditions.\n(2) The firm must have adequate policies for the early identification and\nmanagement of problem assets, and the maintenance of adequate\nprovisions and reserves.\n1.2.3 Principle 3—transactions with related parties\nAn Islamic banking business firm must enter into transactions with\nrelated parties on an arm’s-length basis in order to avoid conflicts of\ninterest.\n1.2.4 Principle 4—concentration risk\nAn Islamic banking business firm must have adequate policies to\nidentify, measure, evaluate, manage and control or mitigate\nconcentrations of risk in a timely way.\n1.2.5 Principle 5—market risk\nAn Islamic banking business firm must have an adequate market risk\nmanagement policy that takes into account the firm’s risk appetite, its\nrisk profile, the market and macroeconomic conditions and the risk of\na significant deterioration in market liquidity.

The firm must\nbe transparent in smoothing any profit payouts.\n1.2.11 Principle 12—Shari’a governance and compliance\nAn Islamic banking business firm must have a Shari’a governance\npolicy that is adequate for the nature, scale and complexity of its\nbusiness and for its risk profile, and to ensure that the firm complies\nwith Shari’a.\nNote For the governing body’s responsibilities relating to:\n• capital adequacy—see rule 3.1.3\n• credit risk and problem assets—see rule 4.1.4\n• transactions with related parties—see rule 4.8.4\n• concentration risk—see rule 5.1.4\n• market risk—see rule 6.1.2\n• operational risk—see CTRL Part 8.2\n• Shari’a compliance—see rule 7.1.5(2)\n• liquidity risk—see rule 8.1.8\n• group risk—see rule 9.1.4\n• PSIAs—see rule 11.1.4\n• rate of return risk— see rule 11.2.3.\npage 10 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nIslamic financial contracts Part 1.3\nRule 1.3.1\nPart 1.3 Islamic financial contracts\nDivision 1.3.A General\n1.3.1 Introduction\nThis Part describes how Shari’a-compliant Islamic financial contracts\nare classified. The contracts and descriptions in this Part are provided\nfor the convenience of readers only and are not intended to be an\nexhaustive.\n1.3.2 Classification of Islamic financial contracts\nIslamic financial contracts can be classified into:\n(a) sale-based contracts such as murabahah and its variations;\n(b) lease-based contracts such as ijarah and its variations;\n(c) equity-based contracts such as musharakah and mudarabah and\ntheir variations;\n(d) loan-based contracts such as qard; and\n(e) service-based contracts such as wakalah and wadi’ah.\nGuidance\nInnovation in Islamic banking products and financial instruments has resulted in\nthe development of varied product structures that are given unique names. Such\nproducts are structured using a combination of Shari’a-compliant terms.\nFor the purpose of computing a firm’s capital requirements, the treatment of such a\nproduct is to be based on the analysis of the product’s risk profile rather than its\nname, unless the Regulatory Authority directs otherwise. For products and\ninstruments structured using a combination of Islamic financial contracts, see rule\n4.5.2 and rule 6.7.2.\nDivision 1.3.B Sale-based contracts\n1.3.3 Murabahah and bai bithaman ajil\n(1) A murabahah contract is an agreement between an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm and an obligor under which the firm sells to the obligor,\nat an agreed fixed price, an asset owned and possessed by the firm.\nThe price is based on the asset’s acquisition cost (purchase price and\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.3 Islamic financial contracts\nRule 1.3.4\nother direct costs) to the firm and a profit margin agreed between the\nfirm and the obligor.\n(2) The contract includes the terms for the obligor to pay the price to the\nfirm after taking delivery of the asset.\n(3) A bai bithaman ajil contract has similar characteristics to, and\nsimilar financing effect as, a murabahah contract. A bai bithaman ajil\ninvolves the selling, on a deferred payment basis, of an asset owned\nand received by the firm.\n1.3.4 Murabahah for purchase orderer\nA murabahah for purchase orderer (or MPO) contract is an\nagreement between an Islamic banking business firm and an obligor\nunder which the firm sells to the obligor, at an agreed price, a\nspecified kind of asset to be acquired and received (physically or\nconstructively) by the firm before selling it to the obligor. The\nagreement to purchase must be binding.\n1.3.5 Difference between murabahah and MPO\n(1) The difference between a murabahah contract and an MPO contract\nis that under a murabahah contract, the firm sells an asset that it\nalready owns.\n(2) In an MPO contract, the firm acquires and receives an asset expecting\nthat the obligor will purchase it. The contract will, therefore, include\nterms for the obligor to pay the price to the firm after taking delivery\nof the asset.\n1.3.6 Tawarruq and commodity murabahah transactions\n(1) Tawarruq is a commodity-based reverse murabahah that involves\n3 independent sales contracts and 3 independent parties. It is\nfrequently used to raise funds or to provide financing in a Shari’a-\ncompliant manner, without involving interest (riba).\n(2) The kind of tawarruq often used by Islamic banking business firms\nfor funding or financing is called commodity murabahah transaction\n(or CMT).\npage 12 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nIslamic financial contracts Part 1.3\nRule 1.3.7\n(3) As a source of funding for an Islamic banking business firm, a CMT\ninvolves a customer first buying and receiving (physically or\nconstructively) a commodity and selling it to the firm on a deferred\npayment basis at an agreed fixed price (with a profit margin) and then\nthe firm itself on-selling the commodity on the spot market to an\nindependent buyer.\n(4) A firm may grant CMT-based financing in the form of commodity\nmurabahah for liquid funds or commodity murabahah financing.\n1.3.7 Commodity murabahah for liquid funds\nIn a commodity murabahah for liquid funds (or CMLF), an Islamic\nbanking business firm uses CMT for interbank operations for\nmanaging short-term liquidity surplus (that is, selling and buying\nShari’a-compliant commodities through murabahah transactions for\nthe firm to invest its surplus liquid funds on a short-term basis with\nother market participants). CMLF is also used where the counterparty\nis the central bank or monetary authority acting as a Shari’a-\ncompliant lender of last resort or offering a standing facility for\neffective liquidity management.\nNote CMLF is commonly called ‘placement’ in conventional banking. This\nshort-term use of a CMT for interbank transactions must be distinguished\nfrom its longer-term use for profit-seeking by raising funds (see rule\n1.3.6(3)) and providing financing (see rule1.3.8).\n1.3.8 Commodity murabahah financing\nIn a commodity murabahah financing (or CMF), an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm provides financing (through a longer-term murabahah)\nfor a customer to buy a commodity that the customer immediately\nresells on the spot market.\n1.3.9 Musawamah\nA musawamah is a contract of sale under which an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm sells to a customer a specified kind of asset for a price\nnegotiated between the firm and the customer, without any reference\nto the price paid or cost incurred by the firm for the asset.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 13\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.3 Islamic financial contracts\nRule 1.3.10\n1.3.10 Salam\n(1) A salam without parallel salam contract is an agreement under which\nan Islamic banking business firm purchases from an obligor, at a\npredetermined price, a specified commodity not currently available\nto the obligor that is to be delivered on a specified future date in a\nspecified quantity and quality. The firm as the purchaser of the\ncommodity pays the purchase price in full at the time the salam\ncontract becomes binding.\n(2) A salam with parallel salam contract is a back-to-back contract to\nsell the commodity purchased under a salam contract to another\ncounterparty. This arrangement enables the Islamic banking business\nfirm to mitigate the risk of holding the commodity.\n1.3.11 Istisna\n(1) An istisna contract is an agreement to sell to, or buy from, an obligor\nan asset that has not yet been manufactured or constructed. The\ncompleted asset must be delivered according to the buyer’s\nspecifications on a specified date and at an agreed price.\n(2) As a seller, an Islamic banking business firm may:\n(a) manufacture or construct the asset on its own; or\n(b) enter into a parallel istisna contract to procure the asset from\nanother party or engage another party (other than the obligor) to\nmanufacture or construct it.\nDivision 1.3.C Lease-based contracts\n1.3.12 Ijarah\n(1) An ijarah contract is a lease under which an Islamic banking business\nfirm (as lessor) grants to an obligor (as lessee) the right to use an asset\nfor an agreed period and specified rental.\n(2) The firm remains the owner of the asset during the lease period. As\nowner, the firm assumes all the liabilities and risks pertaining to the\nasset, including the obligation to restore any impairment and damage\npage 14 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nIslamic financial contracts Part 1.3\nRule 1.3.13\nfrom wear and tear, or from natural causes and not due to the lessee’s\nmisconduct or negligence.\n(3) The firm may acquire the asset to be leased based on the lessee’s\nspecifications under the agreement to lease before entering into the\nijarah contract. The agreement to lease must be binding.\n(4) In an operating ijarah, the firm leases an asset to a customer for an\nagreed period against specified instalments of rental. The price risk\nattached to the residual value of the leased asset at the end of the\ncontract remains with the firm, so that the operating ijarah is\nconsidered an investment for the purpose of calculating capital\nadequacy.\n1.3.13 Ijarah muntahia bittamleek\nAn ijarah muntahia bittamleek (or IMB) contract is a lease\nagreement similar to an ijarah contract. However, the lessee or lessor\nhas the option to have ownership of the leased asset transferred by\nindependent gift or sale at the end of the IMB contract.\n1.3.14 Al-ijarah thumma al-bai\nAn al-ijarah thumma al-bai contract is a type of IMB contract that\nends with the sale of the relevant asset to the lessee through an\nindependent contract of sale entered into by the parties.\nDivision 1.3.D Equity-based contracts\n1.3.15 Musharakah\n(1) A musharakah contract is an agreement between an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm and an obligor to contribute agreed proportions of\ncapital to an enterprise or to acquire an asset.\n(2) Profits generated by the enterprise or asset are shared in accordance\nwith the contract and losses are shared in proportion to the parties’\ncapital contributions. Therefore, a musharakah can be described as a\nprofit-sharing and loss-sharing contract.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 15\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.3 Islamic financial contracts\nRule 1.3.16\n(3) Musharakah contracts can be classified as:\n(a) equity participation in an enterprise to undertake a business\nventure or finance a project; or\n(b) joint ownership in an asset or real estate.\n1.3.16 Equity participation in commercial enterprise\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may enter into a musharakah\ncontract with an obligor to provide capital to participate in the equity\nownership of an enterprise.\n(2) The contract may provide an exit mechanism that allows the firm and\nthe obligor to divest themselves of their interest in the enterprise at\nthe completion of the project or in specified circumstances. The firm\nmust ensure that the contract clearly stipulates any exit mechanism.\n(3) A firm that enters into this category of musharakah contract is\nexposed to risks similar to those of an equity holder who must share\nin the losses as described in rule 1.3.15 (2).\n(4) As an equity holder, the firm would be the first loss-absorber and\nwould have its rights and entitlements subordinated to the claims of\ncreditors.\n1.3.17 Contracts for joint ownership of asset or real estate\nMusharakah contracts that are undertaken for the purpose of joint\nownership of an asset or real estate can be classified as:\n(a) musharakah contract with ijarah subcontract;\n(b) musharakah contract with murabahah subcontract; or\n(c) diminishing musharakah.\npage 16 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nIslamic financial contracts Part 1.3\nRule 1.3.18\n1.3.18 Musharakah contract with ijarah subcontract\nPartners that jointly own an asset or real estate may lease it to a third\nparty or to one of the partners under an ijarah contract and thus\ngenerate rental income for the partnership.\n1.3.19 Musharakah contract with murabahah subcontract\nAs a joint owner of the underlying asset, an Islamic banking business\nfirm is entitled to a share of the revenue generated from the sale of\nthe asset under a murabahah contract.\n1.3.20 Diminishing musharakah\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may enter into a diminishing\nmusharakah contract with an obligor to provide finance based on the\njoint ownership of an asset, with the objective of transferring the\nownership of the asset to the obligor.\n(2) The contract allows the obligor to acquire the firm’s share of\nownership in the asset or equity in the enterprise gradually over the\nlife of the contract.\n(3) As part of the mechanism for the obligor to acquire the firm’s share,\nthe firm and the obligor may agree to lease the asset to the obligor.\nThe rental payable can be structured to reflect the obligor’s\nprogressive acquisition of the firm’s share, so that the obligor will\neventually become full owner of the asset if the obligor continues to\nmake the rental payments.\n(4) A diminishing musharakah begins with the formation of a\npartnership, after which buying and selling of the other partner’s\nequity takes place at market value or the price agreed upon at the time\nof entering into the contract. The ‘buying and selling’ is independent\nof the partnership contract and must not be stipulated in the\npartnership contract, because the buying partner is only allowed to\npromise to buy.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 17\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.3 Islamic financial contracts\nRule 1.3.21\n1.3.21 Mudarabah\n(1) A mudarabah contract is an agreement between an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm and an obligor under which the firm contributes capital\nto an enterprise or business activity that is to be managed by the\nobligor as the entrepreneur (mudarib). The contract can be described\nas a partnership between work and capital, and the mudarib (who\ninvests work but not capital) is exposed only to the loss of fruitless\nwork.\n(2) Profits are shared in accordance with the contract but losses (except\nlosses due to negligence, misconduct, fraud or breach of contract by\nthe mudarib) are borne solely by the firm. Therefore, a mudarabah\ncan be described as a profit-sharing and loss-bearing contract.\nGuidance\nAs the capital provider (rabb al-mal), the firm is at risk of losing its capital\ninvestment disbursed to the mudarib. Firms are encouraged to establish and adopt\nstringent criteria for negligence, misconduct, fraud and breach of contract. Losses\ndue to negligence, misconduct, fraud or breach of contract by the mudarib are borne\nsolely by the mudarib.\n(3) Mudarabah transactions can be carried out:\n(a) on a restricted basis, where the firm authorises the mudarib to\nmake investments based on specified criteria or restrictions such\nas by type of instrument, sector or country exposure; or\n(b) on an unrestricted basis, where the firm authorises the mudarib\nto exercise its discretion to invest funds and undertake business\nactivities.\n(4) Mudarabah contracts can be classified as:\n(a) equity participation in an entity to undertake business ventures;\nor\n(b) investment in project finance.\nNote PSIAs are usually offered on the basis of mudarabah contracts, see\nrule 11.1.2.\npage 18 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nIslamic financial contracts Part 1.3\nRule 1.3.22\n1.3.22 Equity participation in entity to undertake business\nventures\n(1) A mudarabah contract for equity participation in an entity to\nundertake business ventures exposes the Islamic banking business\nfirm concerned to risks similar to those of an equity holder who must\nsolely bear the risk as described in rule 1.3.21 (2).\n(2) As an equity holder, the firm would be the first loss-absorber and\nwould have its rights and entitlements subordinated to the claims of\ncreditors.\n1.3.23 Investment in project finance\n(1) A mudarabah contract for project finance provides finance to a\nconstruction project. An Islamic banking business firm, as an\ninvestor, provides funds to a construction company as mudarib that\nmanages the project.\n(2) The firm is entitled to share the profit of the project but must bear the\nfull losses (if any) arising from the project.\n1.3.24 Equity participation risk\n(1) The risk of loss that arises from an Islamic banking business firm\nentering into musharakah and mudarabah contracts and their\nvariations for the purpose of participating in a particular financing or\nbusiness venture is equity participation risk.\n(2) Equity participation risk, in turn, is a source of capital impairment or\nthe loss of part or all of amount invested by the firm in a business\nventure or the ownership of an asset. In the case of musharakah and\nmudarabah, the firm could lose part or all of its capital as a result of:\n(a) operating losses suffered by the enterprise; or\n(b) a fall in the value of the enterprise’s assets.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 19\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nPart 1.3 Islamic financial contracts\nRule 1.3.25\nDivision 1.3.E Loan-based contracts\n1.3.25 Qard\nQard is a benevolent loan for a fixed period for which no interest or\nother direct or indirect return can be charged.\nDivision 1.3.F Service-based and other contracts\n1.3.26 Wakalah\n(1) Wakalah is a contract of agency.

The categories and elements of\nregulatory capital, and the limits, restrictions and adjustments to\nwhich they are subject are set out in this Chapter.\n(3) Capital supports the firm’s operation by providing a buffer to absorb\nlosses from its activities and, in the event of problems, it enables the\nfirm to continue to operate in a sound and viable manner while the\nproblems are resolved. Capital management must be an integral part\nof the firm’s credit risk management process and must align the firm’s\nrisk appetite and risk profile with its capacity to absorb losses.\nNote For the governing body’s responsibilities in relation to capital\nmanagement and capital adequacy, see rule 3.1.3.\n3.1.2 Chapter 3 and its application to branches\n(1) This Chapter does not apply to an Islamic banking business firm that\nis a branch insofar as this Chapter would require the branch to hold\ncapital.\n(2) A branch is required to comply with the reporting requirements under\nthis Chapter.

A copy\nof the ICAAP must be given to the Regulatory Authority on request.\n(3) An ICAAP must reflect the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s\noperations and must include:\n(a) adequate policies and staff to continuously identify, measure,\nevaluate, manage and control or mitigate the risks arising from\nits activities, and monitor the capital held against such risks;\n(b) a strategy for ensuring that adequate capital is maintained over\ntime, including specific capital targets set out in the context of\nits risk appetite, risk profile and capital requirements;\n(c) plans for how capital targets are to be met and the means\navailable for obtaining additional capital, if required;\n(d) procedures for monitoring its compliance with its capital\nrequirements and capital targets;\n(e) triggers to alert senior management to, and specified actions to\navert and rectify, possible breaches of capital requirements;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 27\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.1 General\nRule 3.1.6\n(f) procedures for reporting on the ICAAP and its outcomes to the\nfirm’s governing body and senior management, and for ensuring\nthat the ICAAP is taken into account in making business\ndecisions;\n(g) policies about the effect on capital of significant risks not\ncovered by explicit capital requirements;\n(h) triggers, scope and procedures for reviewing the ICAAP under\nrule 1.1.14 (3) and in the light of changed conditions and factors\naffecting the firm’s risk appetite, risk profile and capital;\n(i) procedures for reporting the results of reviews;\n(j) an adequate recovery plan for restoring the firm’s financial\nsituation after a significant deterioration; and\n(k) procedures for stress-testing and the review of stress scenarios.\n(4) In addition to the periodic review under rule 1.1.14 (3), a firm’s\nICAAP must be reviewed by an appropriately qualified person at least\nonce every 3 years. The person must be independent of the conduct\nof the firm’s capital management.\n3.1.6 Use of internal models\n(1) The Regulatory Authority’s requirements for Islamic banking\nbusiness firms to maintain adequate capital and manage risk are based\non the approaches set out by the IFSB in its standards and guidelines\non capital adequacy and the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision in the Basel Accords. The standards, guidelines and\nAccords allow firms to use internal models to assess capital adequacy\nand risk, and this rule governs the use of such models.\n(2) A firm must not use its own model to assess capital adequacy or risk\nunless the Regulatory Authority has approved the model. The\nauthority may approve a model subject to 1 or more conditions.\n(3) In making its decision, the authority will take into account:\n(a) the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s business;\npage 28 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nGeneral Part 3.1\nRule 3.1.6\n(b) the standards proposed by the firm, the rigour of its compliance\nwith them, and the ease with which the authority can assess that\ncompliance;\n(c) whether the model can be relied on as a reasonable reflection of\nthe risks undertaken by the firm; and\n(d) anything else the authority considers relevant.\n(4) The authority may revoke the approval if it is satisfied that the firm\nhas failed to comply with any condition specified by the authority or\nany standard proposed by the firm.\n(5) The firm must not stop using an approved model, or make significant\nchanges to it, without the authority’s approval.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 29\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.1A Boundary between banking book and trading book\nRule 3.1A.1\nPart 3.1A Boundary between banking book\nand trading book\n3.1A.1 What banking book and trading book are\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s trading book consists of the\nfirm’s holdings of instruments and transactions that, under this Part,\neither must be held in the trading book or are transferred into the\ntrading book.\n(2) Every other instrument that the firm holds is taken to be held in its\nbanking book.\n3.1A.2 Firms that must have trading book\n(1) Subject to subrule (2), an Islamic banking business firm must have a\ntrading book if it has positions that, under this Part, must be held in\nthe trading book.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm may apply to the Regulatory\nAuthority for approval to hold positions referred to in subrule (1) in\nits banking book if, at any time in the previous 12 months, the total\nvalue of such positions (whether on or off the firm’s balance sheet)\nhas been less than 5% of the total value of the firm’s positions on and\noff its balance sheet.\n3.1A.3 Instruments to be held in trading book only if no\nimpediment to sale etc\nDespite anything else in this Part, an Islamic banking business firm\nmay hold an instrument in the trading book only if there is no legal\nimpediment to the firm’s selling the instrument or fully hedging it in\na Shari’a-compliant way.\n3.1A.4 Instruments in trading book to be fair-valued daily etc\nAn Islamic banking business firm must fair-value every instrument in\nthe trading book daily, and must recognise any value change in the\nfirm’s profit and loss account.\npage 30 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nBoundary between banking book and trading book Part 3.1A\nRule 3.1A.5\n3.1A.5 Meaning of trading intent\nFor this Part, an Islamic banking business firm holds an instrument\nwith trading intent if it holds the instrument for any 1 or more of the\nfollowing purposes:\n(a) short-term resale;\n(b) profiting from actual or expected short-term price movements;\n(c) locking-in arbitrage profits;\n(d) Shari’a-compliant hedging of the risks from an instrument that\nis held for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).\nGuidance\nPeriodic sale activity is not enough on its own to show that an instrument is held\nfor the purpose of short-term resale.\n3.1A.6 Instruments that must be held in trading book\n(1) In general, if an Islamic banking business firm holds an instrument\nwith trading intent it must hold the instrument in the trading book\nunless these rules provide otherwise.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm that holds any of the instruments\nmentioned in subrule (3) is presumed to do so with trading intent.\nTherefore, unless these rules provide otherwise, such an instrument\nmust be held in the trading book.\n(3) The instruments are the following:\n(a) instruments held as accounting trading assets or liabilities;\n(b) instruments resulting from market-making activities;\n(c) equity investments in a fund (other than instruments that must\nbe held in the banking book (see rule 3.1A.7 (1) (d));\n(d) listed equities;\nGuidance\nWith the Regulatory Authority’s approval, certain listed equities may be\nexcluded from the market risk framework. The following are examples of\nequities that may be approved for exclusion:\n• equity positions arising from deferred compensation plans\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 31\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.1A Boundary between banking book and trading book\nRule 3.1A.5\n• convertible debt securities\n• equities taken as a debt previously contracted\n• bank-owned life takaful products\n• legislated programmes.\n(e) trading-related SFTs (that is, transactions that are entered into\nfor the purposes of market-making, locking in arbitrage profits\nor creating short credit or equity positions);\nGuidance\nSFTs that are entered for liquidity management and are valued at accrual for\naccounting purposes are not presumed to be held for trading purposes.\n(f) instruments that include embedded SCHIs from instruments:\n(i) that the firm issued out of the banking book; and\n(ii) that relate to credit or equity risk.\nNote For the meaning of SCHI, see the Glossary.\nGuidance\nAn embedded SCHI is a part of a hybrid contract that includes a non-SCHI\nhost, such as liabilities issued out of the firm’s own banking book that contain\nembedded SCHIs. The embedded SCHI associated with the host should be\nbifurcated and separately recognised on the firm’s balance sheet.\nThis means that the firm should split the liability into two components:\n• the embedded SCHI, which is assigned to the trading book\n• the residual liability, which is retained in the banking book.\nNo internal risk transfers are necessary for the bifurcation. If such a liability\nis unwound, or an embedded option is exercised, both the trading and banking\nbook components are conceptually unwound simultaneously and instantly\nretired; no transfers between trading and banking book are necessary.\n(4) The following instruments must be held in the trading book, unless a\nrule specifically provides otherwise:\n(a) instruments in the firm’s correlation trading portfolio (see\nsubrules (5) to (7));\npage 32 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nBoundary between banking book and trading book Part 3.1A\nRule 3.1A.5\n(b) instruments that would give rise to a net short credit or equity\nposition in the banking book;\nGuidance\nThe firm will have a net short risk position for equity risk or credit risk in the\nbanking book if the present value of the banking book increases when an\nequity price decreases or when a credit spread on an issuer or group of issuers\nof debt increases.\n(c) instruments resulting from securities underwriting\ncommitments.\n(5) An Islamic banking business firm’s correlation trading portfolio\ncomprises the firm’s holdings of securitisation exposures and nth-to-\ndefault SCHIs that meet the following criteria:\n(a) the positions are neither of the following:\n(i) re-securitisation positions;\n(ii) SCHIs of securitisation exposures that do not provide a\npro-rata share in the proceeds of a securitisation tranche;\nGuidance\nTherefore, options on a securitisation tranche, or a synthetically leveraged\nsuper-senior tranche, are excluded.\n(b) all the reference obligations are single-name products (including\nsingle-name SCHIs) for which there is a liquid two-way market\n(see subrule (8)).\nGuidance\nThe instruments referred to in paragraph (b) include commonly traded\nindices based on such reference obligations.\n(6) An Islamic banking business firm may also include, in the correlation\ntrading portfolio, positions:\n(a) that hedge positions described in subrule (5); and\n(b) that are neither securitisation exposures nor nth-to-default\nSCHIs;\nif there is a liquid two-way market (see subrule (8)) for the instrument\nor its underlyings.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 33\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.1A Boundary between banking book and trading book\nRule 3.1A.7\n(7) An Islamic banking business firm must not include in the correlation\ntrading portfolio:\n(a) positions that reference an underlying that would be treated as a\nretail exposure, a residential mortgage exposure or a commercial\nmortgage exposure under the standardised approach to credit\nrisk (see Part 4.4);

The firm’s capital adequacy ratios (consisting of\nCET 1 ratio, total tier 1 ratio and total capital ratio) are calculated by\ndividing its regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets.\n(2) Total risk-weighted assets of an Islamic banking business firm is the\nsum of:\n(a) the firm’s risk-weighted on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet\nitems calculated in accordance with Part 4.4; and\n(b) 12.5 times the sum of the firm’s market and operational risk\ncapital requirements (to the extent that each of those\nrequirements applies to the firm).\nNote For how to calculate the firm’s market risk and operational risk capital\nrequirements, see rule 6.1.1 (3) and Part 7.4, respectively.\n(3) In this Part:\nconsolidated subsidiary, of an Islamic banking business firm, means:\n(a) a subsidiary of the firm; or\n(b) a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the firm.\n3.2.2 Required tier 1 capital on authorisation\n(1) An entity must have, at the time it is authorised, tier 1 capital at least\nequal to:\n(a) for an Islamic bank—QR 35 million;\n(b) for an Islamic investment dealer—QR 7 million.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority will not grant an authorisation unless it is\nsatisfied that the entity complies with this requirement.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 41\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.2 Initial and ongoing capital requirements\nRule 3.2.3\n3.2.3 Required ongoing capital\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must have, at all times, capital at\nleast equal to the higher of:\n(a) its base capital requirement; and\n(b) its risk-based capital requirement.\nNote A firm whose minimum capital requirement is its risk-based capital\nrequirement is subject to the additional requirement to maintain a\ncapital conservation buffer—see rule 3.3.2.\n(2) The amount of capital that a firm must have is its minimum capital\nrequirement.\n3.2.4 Base capital requirement\nThe base capital requirement is:\n(a) QR 35 million for an Islamic bank; and\n(b) QR 7 million for an Islamic investment dealer.\n3.2.5 Risk-based capital requirement\nThe risk-based capital requirement for an Islamic banking business\nfirm is the sum of:\n(a) its credit risk capital requirement;\n(b) its market risk capital requirement; and\n(c) its operational risk capital requirement.\n3.2.6 Capital adequacy ratios\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s capital adequacy is measured\nagainst 3 capital ratios expressed as percentages of its total risk-\nweighted assets.\n(2) A firm’s minimum capital adequacy ratios are:\n(a) a CET 1 capital ratio of 4.5%;\n(b) a tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; and\npage 42 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nInitial and ongoing capital requirements Part 3.2\nRule 3.2.7\n(c) a regulatory capital ratio of 8%.\nNote Under rule 3.3.2, at least 2.5% (by way of a capital conservation buffer)\nmust be held by an Islamic banking business firm in addition to the\nminimum capital adequacy ratios. The firm’s CET 1 capital plus capital\nconservation buffer must therefore be no less than 7% of its total risk-\nweighted assets.\n(3) The Regulatory Authority may, if it believes it is prudent to do so,\nincrease any or all of a firm’s minimum capital adequacy ratios. The\nauthority will notify the firm in writing about a new capital adequacy\nratio and the timeframe for meeting it.\n(4) A firm must maintain, at all times, capital adequacy ratios higher than\nthe required minimum so that adequate capital is maintained in the\ncontext of the firm’s risk appetite, risk profile and capital\nrequirements, and as an additional buffer to absorb losses and\nproblems from market volatility. These higher ratios are the firm’s\nrisk-based capital adequacy ratios.\nDivision 3.2.B Elements of regulatory capital\n3.2.7 Regulatory capital\n(1) The regulatory capital of an Islamic banking business firm is the sum\nof its tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital.\n(2) Tier 1 capital is the sum of a firm’s CET 1 capital and additional\ntier 1 capital.

The claim must be unlimited\nand variable and must be neither fixed nor capped.\n(4) The principal amount of the instrument is perpetual and never\nrepayable except in liquidation. Discretionary repurchases and other\ndiscretionary means of reducing capital allowed by law do not\nconstitute repayment.\nNote Under rule 3.3.6, the Regulatory Authority’s approval is required for a\nreduction in capital.\n(5) The firm does nothing to create an expectation at issuance that the\ninstrument will be bought back, redeemed or cancelled. The statutory\nor contractual terms do not provide anything that might give rise to\nsuch an expectation.\n(6) Distributions are paid out of distributable items of the firm (including\nretained earnings) and the amount of distributions:\n(a) is not tied or linked to the amount paid in at issuance; and\n(b) is not subject to a contractual cap (except to the extent that a firm\nmay not pay distributions that exceed the amount of its\ndistributable items).\n(7) There are no circumstances under which the distributions are\nobligatory. Non-payment of distributions does not constitute default.\n(8) Distributions are paid only after all legal and contractual obligations\nhave been met and payments on more senior capital instruments have\nbeen made. There are no preferential distributions and in particular\nnone for any other elements classified as the highest quality issued\ncapital.\n(9) It is the issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest\nshare of any losses as they occur. Within the highest quality capital,\neach instrument absorbs losses on a going-concern basis\nproportionately and equally with all the others.\nNote This criterion is taken to be satisfied even if the instrument includes a\npermanent write-down mechanism.\n(10) The paid-in amount is recognised as equity capital (rather than as a\nliability) for determining balance-sheet insolvency.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 45\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.2 Initial and ongoing capital requirements\nRule 3.2.10\n(11) The paid-in amount is classified as equity in accordance with the\nrelevant accounting standards.\n(12) The instrument is directly issued and paid-in, and the firm has not\ndirectly or indirectly funded the purchase of the instrument.\n(13) The paid-in amount is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of\nthe firm or a related party, nor subject to any other arrangement that\nlegally or economically enhances the seniority of the holder’s claim\nin relation to the claims of the firm’s creditors.\n(14) The instrument is issued only with the approval of the owners of the\nfirm, either given directly by the owners or, if permitted by the\napplicable law, given by its governing body or by other persons\nauthorised by the owners.\n(15) The instrument is clearly and separately disclosed on the firm’s\nbalance sheet.\n3.2.10 Additional tier 1 capital\nAdditional tier 1 capital is the sum of the following elements:\n(a) instruments, issued by an Islamic banking business firm, that\nsatisfy the criteria in rule 3.2.11 for inclusion in additional tier 1\ncapital (and are not included in CET 1 capital);\n(b) share premium (also known as stock surplus) resulting from the\nissue of instruments included in additional tier 1 capital;\n(c) instruments, issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the firm and\nheld by third parties, that satisfy the criteria in rule 3.2.19 for\ninclusion in additional tier 1 capital (and are not included in\nCET 1 capital);\n(d) regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of additional\ntier 1 capital in accordance with Division 3.2.D.\n3.2.11 Criteria for inclusion in additional tier 1 capital\n(1) An instrument is included in additional tier 1 capital if all of the\ncriteria in subrules (2) to (15) are satisfied.\n(2) The instrument is paid-in.\npage 46 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nInitial and ongoing capital requirements Part 3.2\nRule 3.2.11\n(3) The instrument is the most subordinated claim after those of\ndepositors, general creditors and holders of the subordinated debt of\nthe firm.\n(4) The paid-in amount is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of\nthe firm or a related party, nor subject to any other arrangement that\nlegally or economically enhances the seniority of the holder’s claim\nin relation to the claims of the firm’s creditors.\n(5) The instrument is perpetual.

Adjustments may also be required in relation to assets\nthat cannot readily be converted into cash.\nGuidance\nAdjustments may be required to any of the 3 categories of regulatory capital, but\nmost of them apply to CET 1 capital.\n3.2.23 Approach to valuation for regulatory adjustment\nAn Islamic banking business firm must use the same approach for\nvaluing regulatory adjustments to its capital as it does for balance-\nsheet valuations. An item that is deducted from capital must be valued\nin the same way as it would be for inclusion in the firm’s balance\nsheet.\n3.2.24 Meaning of investment for Division 3.2.D\nIn this Division:\ninvestment by an Islamic banking business firm in an entity includes\nany direct, indirect or synthetic holding of capital instruments issued\nby the entity (and in particular includes an indirect holding that results\nfrom the holding of an index security).\npage 56 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nInitial and ongoing capital requirements Part 3.2\nRule 3.2.25\n3.2.25 How adjustments are to be made\nA regulatory adjustment to an Islamic banking business firm’s\nregulatory capital may be either a deduction from that capital or the\nderecognition of an item for the calculation of the capital.\n3.2.26 Corresponding deduction approach\nIf this Division requires a deduction to be made using the\ncorresponding deduction approach, an Islamic banking business firm\nmust make the deduction from the category of regulatory capital that\nthe holding would qualify as if the firm itself had issued the relevant\ninstrument (or, if the firm does not have sufficient regulatory capital\nin that category, from the next higher category). For that purpose,\nCET 1 capital is the highest category of regulatory capital, additional\ntier 1 capital is the next highest, and tier 2 is the lowest.\nNote For these rules, the 3 categories of regulatory capital are CET 1 capital,\nadditional tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital — see rule 3.2.7 (4).\n3.2.27 Goodwill and intangible assets\nAn Islamic banking business firm must deduct, from its CET 1\ncapital, the amount of its goodwill and other intangible assets (except\nmortgage servicing rights).

It imposes an obligation to restrict a firm’s\ndistributions when capital falls below the capital conservation buffer\nminimum.\n(3) The counter-cyclical capital buffer is a macroprudential tool that can\nbe used to mitigate the build-up of a system-wide risk such as excess\naggregate credit growth. It is intended to ensure that the banking\nsystem has a buffer of capital to protect it against future potential\nlosses.\n(4) These 2 buffers and other requirements on capital are set out in this\nPart.\n3.3.2 Capital conservation buffer\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm whose risk-based capital\nrequirement is higher than its base capital requirement must maintain\na minimum capital conservation buffer of:\n(a) 2.5% of the firm’s total risk-weighted assets; or\n(b) a higher amount that the Regulatory Authority may, by written\nnotice, set from time to time.\npage 68 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nCapital buffers and other requirements Part 3.3\nRule 3.3.3\n(2) A firm’s capital conservation buffer must be made up of CET 1\ncapital above the amounts used to meet the firm’s CET 1 capital ratio,\ntier 1 capital ratio and regulatory capital ratio in rule 3.2.6 (2).\nNote Capital raised through the issuance of sukuk cannot form part of the\ncapital conservation buffer because that capital does not qualify as CET 1\ncapital.\n3.3.3 Capital conservation ratios\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm’s capital conservation buffer falls\nbelow the required minimum, the firm must immediately conserve its\ncapital by restricting its distributions.\nNote A payment made by a firm that does not reduce its CET 1 capital is not a\ndistribution for the purposes of this Part. Distributions include, for\nexample, dividends, share buybacks and discretionary bonus payments.\n(2) This rule sets out, in column 3 of table 3.3.3, the minimum capital\nconservation ratios for Islamic banking business firms that are\nrequired to maintain a capital conservation buffer. Capital\nconservation ratio is the percentage of earnings that a firm must not\ndistribute if its CET 1 capital ratio falls within the corresponding ratio\nin column 2 of that table.\n(3) Earnings means distributable profits calculated before deducting\nelements subject to the restrictions on distributions. Earnings must be\ncalculated after notionally deducting the tax that would have been\npayable had none of the distributable items been paid.\nNote The effect of calculating earnings after tax is that the tax consequence of\nthe distribution is reversed out.\n(4) An Islamic banking business firm must have adequate systems and\ncontrols to ensure that the amount of distributable profits and\nmaximum distributable amount are calculated accurately. The firm\nmust be able to demonstrate that accuracy if directed by the\nRegulatory Authority.\n(5) If the firm is a member of a financial group, the capital conservation\nbuffer applies at group level.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 69\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.3 Capital buffers and other requirements\nRule 3.3.4\nTable 3.3.3 Minimum capital conservation ratios\ncolumn 1 column 2 column 3\nitem CET1 capital ratio minimum capital\nconservation ratio\n(% of earnings)\n1 4.5% to 5.125% 100\n2 > 5.125% to 5.75% 80\n3 > 5.75% to 6.375% 60\n4 > 6.375% to 7.0% 40\n5 > 7% 0\nExamples of application of table\nAssume that a firm’s minimum CET 1 capital ratio is 4.5% and an additional 2.5%\ncapital conservation buffer (which must be made up of CET 1 capital) is required\nfor a total of 7% CET 1 capital ratio. Based on table 3.3.3:\n1 If a firm’s CET 1 capital ratio is 4.5% or more but no more than 5.125%, the\nfirm needs to conserve 100% of its earnings.\n2 If a firm’s CET 1 capital ratio is more than 5.125% or more but no more\nthan 5.75%, the firm needs to conserve 80% of its earnings and must not\ndistribute more than 20% of those earnings by way of dividends, share\nbuybacks and discretionary bonus payments.\n3 A firm with a CET 1 capital ratio of more than 7% can distribute 100% of its\nearnings.\n3.3.4 Powers of Regulatory Authority\n(1) The Regulatory Authority may impose a restriction on capital\ndistributions by an Islamic banking business firm even if the amount\nof the firm’s CET 1 capital is greater than its CET 1 capital ratio and\nrequired capital conservation buffer.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice, impose a limit on\nthe period during which an Islamic banking business firm may\noperate within a specified capital conservation ratio.\n(3) An Islamic banking business firm may apply to the Regulatory\nAuthority to make a distribution in excess of a limit imposed by this\nPart. The authority will grant approval only if it is satisfied that the\npage 70 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCapital adequacy Chapter 3\nCapital buffers and other requirements Part 3.3\nRule 3.3.5\nfirm has appropriate measures to raise capital equal to, or greater than,\nthe amount the firm wishes to distribute above the limit.\n3.3.5 Counter-cyclical capital buffer\n(1) If imposed by the Regulatory Authority, the counter-cyclical capital\nbuffer would require a firm to have additional CET 1 capital against\npossible future losses from system-wide risks such as excess credit\ngrowth.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice, require Islamic\nbanking business firms to have additional CET 1 capital as a counter-\ncyclical capital buffer. The buffer set by the authority will not exceed\n2.5% of total risk-weighted assets.\n(3) The Regulatory Authority will notify firms of any decision to set, or\nincrease, a counter-cyclical capital buffer within a reasonable period\nof not more than 1 year before the date when the decision takes effect.\nHowever, a decision to remove or decrease a counter-cyclical capital\nbuffer will take effect immediately.\n(4) If a counter-cyclical capital buffer applies to a firm, the capital\nconservation ratios (and capital distribution restrictions) in rule 3.3.3\napply to the firm as if its minimum capital conservation buffer were\nincreased by the amount of the counter-cyclical capital buffer.\n3.3.6 Capital reductions\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must not reduce its capital and\nreserves without the Regulatory Authority’s written approval.\nExamples of ways to reduce capital\n• a share buyback or the redemption, repurchase or repayment of capital\ninstruments issued by the firm\n• trading in the firm’s own shares or capital instruments outside an\narrangement agreed with the authority\n• a special dividend.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm planning a reduction must prepare\na forecast (for at least 2 years) showing its projected capital after the\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 71\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 3 Capital adequacy\nPart 3.3 Capital buffers and other requirements\nRule 3.3.7\nreduction.

Reports must be based on the standard\nformat advocated by a relevant professional body.\n4.2.44 Valuation of collateral — reliability of processes\nAn Islamic banking business firm must have policies and processes\ndirected at ensuring that the valuation processes and valuations\nreceived for collateral are reliable. There must be independent and\nregular internal reviews of valuations and the results of automated\nvaluation methods by appropriate management or audit personnel and\nformal reviews by an independent valuer.\n4.2.45 Valuation of collateral — regular reassessment\nAn Islamic banking business firm’s policies and processes must\nprovide for regular assessment of collateral values so as to ensure that\nthe fair value of collateral that supports provisioning and reserves,\nand any collateral coverage measures applied to exposures, is kept\ncurrent and reliably reflects the values that the firm might realise.\nGuidance\nThis is especially important for exposures that are secured by assets that are\nsusceptible to significant changes in value, or if the margin for diminution in the\nvalue of the security is small.\n4.2.46 Valuation of real estate as security\n(1) For the purposes of determining the fair value of security involving\nreal estate, an Islamic banking business firm must assume that:\n(a) the relevant property is accessible in the near future;\n(b) the period for marketing the property will be up to 12 months\n(but the firm may adopt a period of up to 24 months for a\nspecialised or unusual property if a professional valuer advises\nthat it would be appropriate to do so); and\n(c) market conditions and asset values will not change during the\nmarketing period.\npage 100 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk management Part 4.2\nRule 4.2.47\n(2) The marketing period must be treated as retrospective and must be\nassumed to have ended at the date of valuation, rather than taking into\naccount any improvement in market conditions.\n(3) The valuation of real estate must be based on fair values. In\ndetermining fair values, the firm must use conservative estimates in\nimputing future income streams, such as lease payments that are not\nalready contracted for.\n(4) The firm must ensure that the key assumptions used in the valuation\napproach are appropriate and that there is sufficient evidence to\nsupport them. The firm must review the assumptions and must be\nsatisfied that they are reasonable before the valuation is done.\n(5) In determining fair values, a valuation that is based on highest and\nbest use rather than existing use must be adequately supported and\ndocumented. If applicable, the valuation report must set out how\nhighest and best use was determined.\n(6) In circumstances in which it is difficult to determine the fair value of\na property that has not yet achieved a stable income, or that is\nexperiencing fluctuations in income, a forecast of expected cash\nflows must be used to estimate the value of the property.\n(7) The discount rates used in calculating the value of security must\nreflect the opportunity cost of holding the property, determined by\nway of comparison with prevailing returns on competing investments,\nand assuming a long-term holding. Capitalisation rates must reflect\nexpectations about the long-term rate of return that investors require\nunder normal, orderly and sustainable market conditions.\n4.2.47 Valuation of security in other forms\n(1) For collateral in the form of a security interest over assets other than\nreal estate, an Islamic banking business firm must ensure that all\nrelevant security is properly scrutinised.\n(2) If a third party supplies information about a security interest held by\nthe firm, asset values must be objectively assessed to ensure that\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 101\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.2 Credit risk management\nRule 4.2.47\nsecurity coverage is adequate.

If no ECRA has issued a rating of an instrument or a counterparty, the\ninstrument or counterparty is unrated.\n(2) A rating is a solicited rating if the rating was requested and paid for\nby the issuer of the rated instrument, the rated counterparty or another\nentity in the same corporate group as the issuer or counterparty. Any\nother rating is an unsolicited rating.\nNote Unsolicited ratings are not to be used without the Regulatory Authority’s\nconsent — see rule 4.3.5.\n4.3.4 Using ratings\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must use ratings consistently and\nin accordance with these rules and its credit risk management policy.\n(2) The firm must ensure that a rating of an instrument takes into account\nthe total amount of the relevant exposure (that is, the financing and\nany profit due).\n4.3.5 Only solicited ratings to be used\n(1) Subject to subrule (2), an Islamic banking business firm must use only\na solicited rating in determining risk weights for the firm’s exposures.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm may use an unsolicited rating with\nthe written approval of the Regulatory Authority or in accordance\nwith a direction by the Authority.

Consequently, only senior claims on that issuer benefit from\na high-quality issuer rating. Other unassessed exposures of a highly rated issuer are\ntreated as unrated.\n(5) If an issuer has a specific high-quality rating (that is, a rating that\nwould map to a lower risk weight) that applies only to a limited class\nof its liabilities (such as a deposit assessment or a counterparty risk\nassessment), the firm may use that rating only for exposures to the\nissuer that fall within that class.\n4.3.8 Ratings within financial group\nAn Islamic banking business firm must not use a rating for 1 entity in\na financial group to assign a risk weight to an unrated entity in the\ngroup.\nGuidance\nIf the rated entity has guaranteed the unrated entity’s exposure to the firm, the firm\nmay take the guarantee into account as credit risk mitigation under Division 4.6.C\nif the guarantee is an eligible guarantee (see rule 4.6.32).\n4.3.9 Using foreign currency and domestic currency ratings of\nsimilar exposures to same counterparty\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm proposes to assign a risk weight\nto an unrated exposure based on the rating of a rated (but otherwise\nsimilar) exposure to the same counterparty, it may do so if either of\nthe following paragraphs is true:\n(a) the rating is a domestic-currency rating and the rated exposure\nis denominated in the counterparty’s domestic currency;\n(b) the rating is a foreign-currency rating and the rated exposure is\ndenominated in a foreign currency.\n(2) Subrule (3) applies to an exposure that arises through an Islamic\nbanking business firm’s participation in a financing that has been\nextended, or has been guaranteed against convertibility and transfer\npage 106 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit ratings Part 4.3\nRule 4.3.10\nrisk, by an MDB, if an exposure to the MDB is to be assigned a risk\nweight of 0% under rule 4.4.16.\n(3) For an exposure to which this subrule applies, the borrower’s\ndomestic currency rating may be used to assign a risk weight to the\nexposure instead of its foreign currency rating. In the case of a\nguarantee against convertibility and transfer risk, the local currency\nrating may be used only for the part that has been guaranteed, and the\nremainder that does not benefit from the guarantee must be assigned\na risk weight based on the borrower’s foreign currency rating.\n4.3.10 Using short-term ratings\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may use a short-term rating to\nassign a risk weight only to a short-term bank exposure or short-term\ncorporate exposure.\n(2) For risk-weighting purposes, an Islamic banking business firm must\ntreat a short-term rating as being issue-specific. The firm may use a\nshort-term rating to assign a risk weight only to an exposure arising\nfrom the rated facility, and must not apply it to any other short-term\nexposure.\n(3) An Islamic banking business firm must not use a short-term rating to\nassign a risk weight to an unrated long-term exposure.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 107\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.1\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to\ncalculating credit risk capital\nrequirement\nDivision 4.4.A General\n4.4.1 What Part 4.4 does — calculation of risk-weighted assets\nfor credit risk\n(1) This Part sets out how an Islamic banking business firm must\ncalculate its risk-weighted assets for credit risk.\nGuidance\n1 An Islamic banking business firm’s credit risk capital requirement is the sum\nof:\n• its risk-weighted assets for credit risk, as calculated in accordance with\nthis Part (but subject to any capital relief that is available under Part 4.6)\n• its risk-weighted assets for securitisation exposures in the banking book\n(see Part 10.4).\n2 For how to calculate the firm’s credit risk capital requirement, see rule 4.1.4.\nThe following components of the credit risk capital requirement are calculated\nin accordance with this Part:\n• RWA for exposures in the banking book (except those mentioned in the\nnext point)\n• RWA for the risk posed by unsettled transactions and failed trades, in\nboth the banking book and the trading book.\n3 The firm’s RWA for counterparty credit risk for exposures in both the banking\nbook and the trading book also forms part of its credit risk capital requirement.\nThis is dealt with in Part 4.6A.\n4 The sum of an Islamic banking business firm’s risk-weighted assets for credit\nrisk, used for calculating its credit risk capital requirement, is not the same as\nits total risk-weighted assets (see rule 3.2.1), which is used for calculating the\nfirm’s capital adequacy ratios under Chapter 3.\npage 108 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.2\n4.4.2 Application of Part 4.4 between banking book and trading\nbook\nThis Part applies only to assets and exposures held in an Islamic\nbanking business firm’s banking book unless a rule specifies\notherwise.\nNote Subdivisions 4.4.B.12 (unsettled or failed transactions) and 4.4.B.13\n(defaulted exposures) and Part 4.6A (counterparty credit risk) apply to\nassets and exposures in both banking and trading books.\n4.4.3 Risk weights to be assigned\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must assign risk weights to on-\nbalance-sheet exposures and off-balance-sheet items. This Part sets\nout how to do so.\nGuidance\nRisk weights are broadly aligned with the likelihood of the counterparty’s default.\nIf an exposure or item is rated (see rule 4.3.3), the risk weight to be assigned is\ndetermined in accordance with the rating; otherwise, the risk weight is determined\ndirectly by this Part (but in both cases subject to the outcome of due diligence by\nthe firm (see rules 4.2.25, 4.2.26 and 4.2.27).\n(2) The firm must assign the risk weight set out in, or determined in\naccordance with, this Part to a claim or asset, subject to:\n(a) the outcome of the credit assessment required by rules 4.2.25,\n4.2.26 and 4.2.27; and\n(b) its assessment of the exposure, as required by rule 4.4.4.\n(3) Under this Part, risk weights must be assigned to exposures of a\nparticular kind at specified levels (for example, in the case of rated\nbank exposures (other than certain short-term exposures), the risk\nweights that can be assigned are 20%, 30%, 50%, 100% and 150%,\naccording to the rating of the counterparty (see rule 4.4.18)). If this\nPart specifies a set of such levels in relation to a kind of exposure,\nonly risk weights in the set may be assigned to such an exposure.\nGuidance\nSubrule (3) would prevent an Islamic banking business firm from (for example)\nassigning an intermediate risk weight (say 60%) to a rated bank exposure.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 109\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.4\n(4) For the purpose of assigning risk weights, profit is treated as\nsuspended on a non-performing exposure.\n4.4.4 Requirement to decide whether risk weight appropriate\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must assess every exposure\n(whether rated or unrated) to decide whether the risk weight to be\nassigned to it under this Part is appropriate. The firm’s decision must\nbe based on the exposure’s inherent risk.\n(2) If there are reasonable grounds to believe that the inherent risk of an\nexposure is significantly higher than that implied by the risk weight\nto be assigned to it under this Part, the firm must consider the higher\nrisk (and assign a higher risk weight) for the purpose of calculating\nits credit risk capital requirement.\n(3) In particular, the firm must use the results of due diligence carried out\non the counterparty to decide whether a risk weight that is solely\nbased on a rating would be appropriate and prudent. If the results\nshow that the exposure poses greater risk than is implied by the rating,\nthe firm must assign a higher risk weight to the exposure than the risk\nweight that would be assigned on the basis of the rating.\nNote For the risk weights that can be assigned, see rule 4.4.3 (3).\n(4) However, due diligence analysis must never result in the application\nof a lower risk weight than that determined by the rating.\n(5) For an exposure to an entity that is part of a corporate group, the firm\nmust, as far as possible, carry out due diligence at the level of the\nentity to which there is an exposure. However, in evaluating the\nentity’s repayment capacity, the firm must take into account the\nsupport of the group and the possibility that the support would be\nadversely affected by problems in the group.\n4.4.5 Relation to CRM techniques\nIf a claim, exposure or asset to which an Islamic banking business\nfirm must assign a risk weight is covered by a CRM technique, the\nfirm may take the effect of that technique into account, in accordance\nwith Part 4.6, to reduce the firm’s credit risk capital requirement.\npage 110 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.6\n4.4.6 Regulatory Authority can direct firms as to risk weights\nand impose requirements\n(1) Despite anything in these rules, the Regulatory Authority may direct\nan Islamic banking business firm as to the risk weight to be assigned\nto a particular exposure if the Authority considers that the firm has\nassigned an inappropriate risk weight to the exposure. The direction\nmust be in writing.\n(2) The Authority may also impose specific capital requirements or limits\non significant exposures, including any exposure that, in the\nAuthority’s opinion, has not been adequately transferred or mitigated.\n4.4.7 Risk weight multiplier for exposures with currency\nmismatch\n(1) This rule applies to an exposure if:\n(a) the exposure and the counterparty’s income are denominated in\ndifferent currencies; and\n(b) the counterparty does not have a sufficient natural or financial\nhedge against the resulting foreign exchange risk.\nGuidance\nA counterparty has a natural hedge if the borrower normally receives foreign\ncurrency income (such as remittances, rental incomes, or salaries) in the currency\nof the relevant financing. A financial hedge generally includes a contract with a\nfinancial institution.\n(2) This rule applies to all exposures referred to in subrule (1) regardless\nof whether the exposure is to an individual, a corporate body or a\nsovereign.\n(3) The exposure must be assigned a risk weight 1.5 times the risk weight\nthat would otherwise be assigned under this Part, subject to a\nmaximum risk weight of 150%.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 111\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.8\nDivision 4.4.B Standardised approach — on-\nbalance-sheet exposures\nSubdivision 4.4.B.1 General concepts and definitions\n4.4.8 Scope of Division 4.4.B\nThis Division is about how an Islamic banking business firm must\nassign risk weights to exposures that are held on its balance sheet.\nNote This Division applies only to exposures in the banking book unless a rule\nprovides otherwise — see rule 4.4.2.\n4.4.9 Types of exposures by counterparty\n(1) For this Division, an exposure on an Islamic banking business firm’s\nbalance sheet may be classified as of one of the following types:\n(a) a sovereign exposure (see subrule (3));\n(b) a PSE exposure (see subrule (4));\n(c) an MDB exposure (see subrule (5));\n(d) a bank exposure (see subrule (6));\n(e) a corporate exposure (see subrule (7)).\n(2) To avoid any doubt, for this Division, exposure includes a claim by\nway of financing or investment by way of sukuk.\n(3) A sovereign exposure is a claim on a counterparty that is:\n(a) a national government (or the government of a body politic that\nis part of a nation, such as a State or Province);\n(b) a national central bank;

It is the most granular\nand risk-sensitive approach. However, the necessary information to use it may\nnot be available.\n2 The MBA relies on information in a fund’s mandate or the law governing the\nfund to assign risk weights to the fund’s exposures.\n3 The FBA is used only when neither of the other approaches is possible.\n(2) If the fund’s RWA was calculated by the LTA or the MBA, the fund’s\nRWA is subject to a leverage adjustment (see rule 4.4.51) to calculate\nthe RWA for the firm’s investment in the fund.\nGuidance\nUnder the LTA or the MBA, the firm calculates the RWA for an investment in a\nfund by first calculating an RWA for the fund. The RWA for the firm’s investment\nin the fund is taken (subject to the leverage adjustment) to be the fund’s total RWA\nmultiplied by the percentage of the fund’s total equity that the firm holds.\n4.4.43 When to use LTA\n(1) If the conditions in subrule (2) are satisfied, an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm must use the LTA to assign a risk weight to a fund’s\nexposures to its underlyings.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 137\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.44\n(2) The conditions are the following:\n(a) the fund provides the firm with sufficient information about the\nfund’s underlying exposures to allow the firm to calculate the\nrelevant risk weights;\n(b) the fund provides that information as often as necessary for that\npurpose;\n(c) the information is verified by an independent third party (for\nexample, the depository, the custodian bank, or, if there is a fund\nmanagement company, that company).\n4.4.44 Applying LTA\n(1) Under the LTA, risk weights are assigned to the exposures of the fund\nas if the Islamic banking business firm concerned held those\nexposures directly.\nGuidance\nSuch exposures include, for example, underlying exposures arising from the fund’s\nactivities in SCHIs for situations in which the underlying receives a risk-weighting\ntreatment under Part 4.6A and the associated counterparty credit risk exposure.\n(2) In determining the counterparty credit risk for the fund’s exposures\nto SCHIs, the firm must multiply the relevant exposure (calculated in\naccordance with Part 4.6A) by 1.5 before applying the risk weight\nassociated with the counterparty.\n(3) The firm may rely on a third party’s calculations if the conditions in\nrule 4.4.47 are met.\n4.4.45 When to use MBA\nAn Islamic banking business firm may use the MBA if the conditions\nfor using the LTA are not satisfied, but enough information to apply\nthe MBA is available from the fund’s mandate, the applicable law or\nother reliable, public sources.\npage 138 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.46\n4.4.46 Applying MBA\n(1) Under the MBA, the total RWA for a fund’s exposures is the sum of\nthe following:\n(a) the total RWA for exposures on the fund’s balance sheet,\ncalculated as set out in subrule (2);\n(b) the total RWA for the fund’s exposures to SCHIs and other off-\nbalance-sheet items, calculated as set out in subrule (3);\n(c) the total RWA for the fund’s exposures to SCHIs, calculated in\naccordance with Part 4.6A.\n(2) For paragraph (1) (a), the calculation must assume that the fund’s\nunderlying portfolios are invested to the greatest extent allowed under\nits mandate in assets that attract the highest capital requirements, and\nthen progressively in other assets that attract lower capital\nrequirements. If more than 1 risk weight can be assigned to an\nexposure, the highest risk weight applicable must be assigned.\n(3) For paragraph (1) (b):\n(a) in the case of an off-balance-sheet item, if the underlying would\nreceive a risk weight under Division 4.4.C, the notional amount\nof the item must be assigned a risk weight accordingly; and\n(b) in the case of an SCHI exposure, if the underlying would receive\na risk weight under Part 4.6A, the notional amount of the\nexposure must be assigned a risk weight accordingly.\n(4) The firm may rely on a third party’s calculations if the conditions in\nrule 4.4.47 are met.\n4.4.47 Applying LTA or MBA — using third party’s calculations\n(1) The conditions under which an Islamic banking business firm may\nuse a third party’s calculations of the risk weight of the firm’s\ninvestment in a fund are the following:\n(a) the party that does the calculation is:\n(i) if the fund invests only in securities and deposits the\nsecurities at a depository institution — the depository; or\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 139\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.48\n(ii) another entity approved by the Regulatory Authority;\n(b) the calculations are done in accordance with the LTA or the\nMBA;\n(c) the firm is given complete access to the calculations and data;\n(d) before the firm uses the results of such a calculation in a\nprudential report, the calculation is reviewed by the firm’s\ninternal audit function;\n(e) all the calculations for a year are reviewed by the firm’s external\nauditor as part of the firm’s annual audit.\n(2) If the firm uses a third party’s calculations of the risk weight of the\nfirm’s investment in a fund, the firm must assign, to its exposure to\nthe fund, a risk weight 1.2 times the risk weight that the firm would\nhave assigned if it had held the exposure directly.\n(3) However, if the firm has access to the calculations, and the\nRegulatory Authority so requests, the firm must provide the Authority\nwith details of the calculations. In this case, subrule (2) does not\napply.\nGuidance\nIf the firm uses a third party’s calculations, and provides the Authority with details\nof the calculations as set out in subrule (3), the firm must assign risk weights in\naccordance with rule 4.4.44 or 4.4.46, according to the method that the firm used\ninitially.\n4.4.48 When to use FBA\nAn Islamic banking business firm must use the FBA if it cannot use\neither the LTA or the MBA.\n4.4.49 Applying FBA\nUnder the FBA, an Islamic banking business firm must assign a risk\nweight of 1,250% to the firm’s equity in the relevant fund.\n4.4.50 Treatment of funds’ investments in other funds\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm has an investment in a fund\n(fund 1) that has an investment in another fund (fund 2), and either\npage 140 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.51\nthe LTA or the MBA was used to calculate the RWA of fund 1, the\nrisk weight to be assigned to fund 2 can be calculated by using the\nLTA, MBA or FBA (as the available information permits).\n(2) For all subsequent layers (such as fund 2’s investment in another fund\n(fund 3) and so on), the risk weights applied to fund n can be\ncalculated by using the LTA only if the LTA was used for\ndetermining the risk weight for fund (n-1). Otherwise, the FBA must\nbe applied.\n4.4.51 Leverage adjustment\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm has calculated the RWA for a\nfund using either the LTA or the MBA, it must apply a leverage\nadjustment to that RWA. The result of applying the leverage\nadjustment is taken as the RWA for the firm’s investment in the fund.\n(2) If LTA or MBA is used to calculate the RWA for. an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm’s investment in a fund, the RWA for the investment is\ncalculated by the following formula:\n𝑅𝑊𝐴\n𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑\n𝑅𝑊𝐴 = ×𝐿𝑣 ×𝐸𝑞\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠\n𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑\nwhere:\nRWA is the fund’s total RWA.\nfund\nTotal assets is the fund’s total assets, according to its latest\nfund\nbalance sheet.\nLv is:\n(a) if the LTA was applied — the fund’s actual leverage (that is, the\nfund’s total assets divided by its equity, expressed as a\npercentage);\n(b) if the MBA was applied — the highest rate of leverage permitted\nby the relevant mandate or law.\nEq is the firm’s equity in the fund (that is, the product of the fund’s\ntotal equity and the percentage of that equity that the firm holds).\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 141\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.51\n(3) However, the application of a leverage adjustment to an investment\nin a fund is not to increase the risk weight of the investment higher\nthan 1,250%.\nExample\nConsider a fund that replicates an equity index. An Islamic banking business firm\nholds 20% of the fund’s shares. Also, assume that:\n(1) the firm uses the standardised approach (as set out in Divisions 4.4.B and\n4.4.C) when calculating its capital requirements for credit risk, and it uses the\nstandardised approach for determining counterparty credit risk exposures.\n(2) the fund holds forward contracts on listed equities that are cleared through a\nQCCP (with a notional amount of 100); and\n(3) the fund presents the following balance sheet:\nAssets\nCash 20\nGovernment sukuk (AAA-rated) 30\nVM receivable (that is, collateral 50\nposted by the firm to the CCP in\nrespect of the forward contracts)\nLiabilities\nNotes payable 5\nEquity\nShares, retained earnings and other 95\nreserves\nThe fund’s exposures must be risk-weighted as follows:\n(1) the RWA for the cash (RWA ) is the exposure of 20 multiplied by the\ncash\napplicable SA risk weight of 0%. Thus, RWA = 0;\ncash\n(2) the RWA for the government sukuk (RWA ) is the exposure of 30 multiplied\nsukuk\nby the applicable SA risk weight of 0%. Thus, RWA = 0;\nsukuk\n(3) the RWA for the exposures to the listed equities underlying the forward\ncontracts (RWA ) is the product of the following 3 amounts:\nunderlying\n(a) the SA credit conversion factor of 100% that is applicable to forward\npurchases;\n(b) the exposure to the notional amount of $100;\npage 142 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.51\n(c) the applicable risk weight for listed equities under the SA which is\n100%;\nthus, RWA = 100% × 100 × 100% = 100;\nunderlying\n(4) the forward purchase equities expose the bank to counterparty credit risk in\nrespect of the market value of the forwards and the collateral posted that is not\nheld by the CCP on a bankruptcy-remote basis. For the sake of simplicity,\nassume that the application of Part 4.6A results in an exposure value of $56.\nThe RWA for counterparty credit risk (RWA ) is the product of the\nCCR\nexposure amount and the relevant risk weight for trade exposures to CCPs,\nwhich is 2% in this case (see 4.6A.D for the capital requirements for bank\nexposures to CCPs). Thus, RWA = $56 × 2% = $1.12. (For the sake of\nCCR\nsimplicity, this example does not include capital requirements for exposures\nto CCPs or the credit valuation adjustment framework.)\nThe total RWA of the fund is therefore $101.12 = (0 + 0 +100 + 1.12).\nThe leverage of a fund under the LTA is the ratio of the fund’s total assets to its\n100\ntotal equity, which in this example is .\n95\nTherefore, the RWA for the bank’s equity investment in the fund is the product of\nthe average risk weight of the fund, the fund’s leverage and the size of the bank’s\nequity investment — that is:\n𝑅𝑊𝐴\n𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑\n𝑅𝑊𝐴= ×𝐿𝑣×𝐸𝑞\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠\n𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑\nor\n101.12 100\n× ×(95×20%)=$=20.2.\n100 95\nGuidance\nThe counterparty credit risk exposure of a netting set of SCHIs is calculated by\nmultiplying the sum of the replacement cost and potential future exposure by an\nalpha factor set at 1.4. Whenever the replacement cost is unknown, the exposure\nmeasure for counterparty credit risk will be calculated conservatively by using the\nsum of the notional amounts of the SCHIs in the netting set as a proxy for the\nreplacement cost, and the multiplier used in the calculation of the potential future\nexposure will be equal to 1. Whenever the potential future exposure is unknown, it\nwill be calculated as 15% of the sum of the notional values of the SCHIs in the\nnetting set. The risk weight associated with the counterparty is applied to the\ncounterparty credit risk exposure.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 143\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.52\nSubdivision 4.4.B.10 Exposures secured on real estate\n4.4.52 Scope of Subdivision 4.4.B.10 — risk-weighting\nexposures secured on real estate\n(1) This Subdivision is about how an Islamic banking business firm must\nassign risk weights to exposures that are secured on real estate and\nare on its balance sheet.\n(2) This Subdivision does not apply to a defaulted exposure, nor to an\nexposure resulting from an unsettled or failed transaction.\nNote For the treatment of exposures resulting from unsettled or failed\ntransactions and defaulted exposures, see Subdivisions 4.4.B.12 and\n4.4.B.13 respectively.\n4.4.53 Definitions for Subdivision 4.4.B.10\nIn this Subdivision:\ncommercial real estate exposure means an exposure that is secured\nby mortgage over real estate, but is not a residential real estate\nexposure.\nmortgage includes any form of security interest over real estate.\nresidential real estate exposure means an exposure that is secured by\nmortgage over real estate, if the real estate:\n(a) has (or will, on completion, have) the nature of 1 or more\ndwellings; and\n(b) satisfies all the applicable laws and regulations necessary to\nenable it to be occupied as housing (or will, on completion,\nsatisfy all such laws and regulations).\n4.4.54 Classification of real estate exposures\n(1) The real estate exposure asset class consists of:\n(a) exposures, secured by mortgage over real estate, that are\nqualifying real estate exposures;\n(b) other exposures secured by mortgage over real estate; and\n(c) land acquisition, development and construction exposures.\npage 144 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.55\n(2) An exposure secured by mortgage over real estate is a qualifying real\nestate exposure if it meets the requirements in rule 4.4.55.\n4.4.55 Prudential requirements\n(1) The requirements referred to in rule 4.4.54 (2) (the prudential\nrequirements) are the requirements in subrules (2) to (7).\n(2) Finished property: the exposure must be secured by either:\n(a) a fully completed property; or\n(b) residential property under construction, or land upon which\nresidential property will be constructed, but only if:\n(i) both of the following are true:\n(A) the property is a residential housing unit for 1 to 4\nfamilies, and it will be the borrower’s primary\nresidence;\n(B) the lending is not, in effect, indirectly financing land\nacquisition, development and construction; or\n(ii) a sovereign or PSE has the legal powers and ability to\nensure that the property will be finished.\n(3) Legal enforceability: the security must be legally enforceable in all\nthe relevant jurisdictions.

For what qualifies\nas an eligible guarantee, see rule 4.6.32.\n(2) The firm may also take into account mortgage indemnity takaful that\nmeets the requirements of Part 4.6 for a guarantee (so far as possible).\n(3) However, for the purpose of assigning a risk weight to an exposure,\nits FTV ratio must be determined without taking any CRM technique\ninto account.\n4.4.61 Qualifying real estate exposures\nQualifying real estate exposures are classified according to whether\nrepayment is dependent on cash flows generated by the property, as\nfollows:\n(a) residential exposures repayment of which is not materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by the property;\n(b) residential exposures repayment of which is materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by the property;\n(c) commercial exposures repayment of which is not materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by the property;\n(d) commercial exposures repayment of which is materially\ndependent on cash flows generated by the property.\nNote 1 For the meaning of qualifying real estate exposure, see rule 4.4.54 (2).\npage 148 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nStandardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement Part 4.4\nRule 4.4.64\nNote 2 For the meaning of materially dependent on cash flows generated by the\nproperty, see rule 4.4.64.\n4.4.62 Meaning of qualifying residential real estate exposure\nA qualifying residential real estate exposure is a qualifying real\nestate exposure that is secured on a property that has the nature of a\ndwelling and satisfies (or, for residential property under construction,\nwill, when completed, satisfy) all the applicable laws and regulations\nto enable it to be occupied for housing.\n4.4.63 Meaning of qualifying commercial real estate exposure\nA qualifying commercial real estate exposure is a qualifying real\nestate exposure that is not a qualifying residential real estate\nexposure.\n4.4.64 Meaning of materially dependent on cash flows generated\nby the property\n(1) A qualifying real estate exposure (whether residential or commercial)\nis materially dependent on cash flows generated by the property if\nthe borrower’s prospects of servicing the financing materially depend\non the cash flows generated by the property that secures the financing\nrather than on the borrower’s capacity to do so from other sources\n(but see subrule (2)).\nGuidance\n1 The primary source of the cash flows generated by the property would\ngenerally be lease or rental payments, or the sale of the property. The\ndistinguishing characteristic of these exposures compared to other qualifying\nreal estate exposures is that both the servicing of the financing and the\nprospects for recovery in the event of default depend materially on the cash\nflows generated by the property securing the exposure.\n2 The material dependence condition set out above predominantly applies to\nfinancings to corporates or SPVs, but is not restricted to such borrowers. For\nexample, a financing might be considered materially dependent if more than\n50% of the income from the borrower used in the bank's assessment of its\nability to service the financing is from cash flows generated by a residential\nproperty.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 149\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.4 Standardised approach to calculating credit risk capital requirement\nRule 4.4.65\n(2) The following are exceptions to the general rule in subrule (1) (that\nis, the following types of exposure are not treated as exposures the\nrepayment of which is materially dependent on cash flows generated\nby the property that secures them):\n(a) exposures secured on a property that is the borrower’s primary\nresidence;\n(b) exposures, secured on an income-producing residential housing\nunit, to an individual who has mortgaged fewer than 50% of the\nproperties in the relevant development;\n(c) exposures, secured on residential real estate, to an association or\ncooperative of individuals:\n(i) that is regulated under national law;

In this situation,\nthe firm may lease or dispose of the asset to another party, but the\nfirm is also exposed to credit risk if the lessee is not able to\ncompensate it for the losses incurred arising from the disposal of the\nasset.\n(3) In an ijarah contract, the underlying asset is not eligible collateral for\npurposes of credit risk mitigation.\n(4) An IMB contract is treated as a financing agreement and must be risk-\nweighted in accordance with table 4.5.6.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 171\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.5 Risk-weightings for Islamic financial contracts\nRule 4.5.6\nTable 4.5.6 Credit risk-weights for IMB contracts\nstage of contract credit risk-weight\nasset available for lease and based on the lessee’s type and rating under\non firm’s balance sheet Part 4.4, with the applicable risk-weight\napplied to the acquisition cost\nlease contract has become based on the lessee’s type and rating under\nbinding and rental payments Part 4.4, with the applicable risk-weight\ndue from lessee applied to net receivables (that is, total\nestimated value of lease receivables for the\nremaining period plus the residual value of the\nleased asset at the end of the contract)\n(5) An operating ijarah is treated as an investment and must be risk-\nweighted in accordance with subrule (6), (7), (8) or (9), depending on\nthe leased asset and how the investment is made.\n(6) If the investment is made by the firm itself (direct investment\nexposure), the risk-weighted amount of the direct investment\nexposure must be calculated by multiplying the carrying value of the\nasset by 150%.\n(7) If the investment is made by the firm indirectly (indirect investment\nexposure) through a subsidiary, its share or equity investment in the\ncapital of the subsidiary must be risk-weighted at 150% and any\nfinancing provided by the firm to the subsidiary must be risk-\nweighted at the same rate.\n(8) If the investment is made by the firm indirectly (indirect investment\nexposure) through a joint venture or partnership, the indirect\ninvestment exposure must be risk-weighted at:\n(a) 300% if the firm has majority ownership over the asset and can\nexit the investment at any time;

The use of such techniques\nmust be treated as complementary to, rather than a replacement for,\nthorough credit risk assessment.\nGuidance\nAlthough the use of CRM techniques reduces or transfers credit risk, it may at the\nsame time increase other risks (that is, residual risks). Residual risks include legal,\noperational, liquidity and market risks. Therefore, Islamic banking business firms\nmust employ robust procedures and processes to control such risks, including\nstrategy; consideration of the underlying credit; valuation; policies and procedures;\nsystems; control of roll-off risks; and management of concentration risk arising\nfrom the firm’s use of CRM techniques and its interaction with the firm’s overall\ncredit risk profile. If such risks are not adequately controlled, the Regulatory\nAuthority may impose additional capital charges or take other supervisory action.\nNote Under rule 4.4.5, if a claim or asset to which an Islamic banking business\nfirm must assign a risk weight is secured by eligible collateral or a\nguarantee (or is covered by an SCHI or a netting agreement), the firm\nmay apply this Part to reduce the firm’s credit risk capital requirement.\n4.6.2 Choice of CRM techniques\n(1) CRM techniques include:\n(a) accepting collateral, standby letters of credit and guarantees;\n(b) using SCHIs; and\n(c) using netting agreements.\nGuidance\n1 An Islamic banking business firm should not rely excessively on collateral or\nguarantees to mitigate credit risk. While collateral or guarantees may provide\nsecondary protection to the firm if the counterparty defaults, the primary\nconsideration for credit approval should be the counterparty’s repayment\nability.\n2 An Islamic banking business firm that provides mortgages at high FTV ratios\nshould consider the need for alternative forms of protection against the risks\npage 180 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.3\nof such lending, in order to protect itself against the risk of a fall in the value\nof the property.\n(2) In choosing a CRM technique, the firm must consider:\n(a) the firm’s knowledge of, and experience in using, the technique;\n(b) the cost-effectiveness of the technique;\n(c) the type and financial strength of the counterparties or issuers;\n(d) the correlation of the technique with the underlying credits;\n(e) the availability, liquidity and realisability of the technique;\n(f) the extent to which documents in common use can be adopted;\nand\n(g) the degree of recognition of the technique by financial services\nregulators.\n4.6.3 Requirements — CRM techniques\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s credit risk management policy\nmust set out the conditions under which CRM techniques may be\nused. The policy must enable the firm to manage CRM techniques\nand the risks associated with their use.\n(2) The firm must analyse the protection given by CRM techniques to\nensure that any residual credit risk is identified, measured, evaluated,\nmanaged and controlled or mitigated.\n(3) The policy must include procedures for:\n(a) setting mark-up rates according to the risk rating of the\ncounterparties;\n(b) taking account of governing laws for contracts relating to\nfinancing transactions; and\n(c) assessing the risks and obligations from the firm’s own\nexposures in parallel transactions such as those in salam and\nistisna.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 181\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.4\n(4) If the firm accepts collateral, its policy must state the types of\ncollateral that it will accept, and the basis and procedures for valuing\ncollateral.\n(5) If the firm uses netting agreements, it must have a netting policy that\nsets out its approach. The netting policy must provide for monitoring\nnetting agreements and must enable the firm to monitor and report\nnetted transactions on both gross and net bases.\n4.6.4 When CRM techniques reduce credit risk capital\nrequirement\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s use of a CRM technique reduces\nthe firm’s credit risk capital requirement only if the technique and\nevery document that gives effect to it are binding on all parties and\nenforceable in all the relevant jurisdictions.\nGuidance\nWhen accepting collateral, an Islamic banking business firm must ensure that any\nnecessary legal procedures have been followed, to ensure that the collateral can be\nenforced.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm must review the enforceability of a\nCRM technique that it uses. The firm must have a well-founded legal\nbasis for any conclusion about enforceability, and must carry out\nfurther reviews to ensure that the technique remains enforceable.\nGuidance\nAn Islamic banking business firm should consider whether independent legal\nopinion should be sought on the enforceability of documents. The documents\nshould be ready before the firm enters into a contractual obligation or releases\nfunds.\n(3) The effects of a CRM technique must not be double-counted. The\nfirm is not allowed to obtain capital relief if:\n(a) the risk weight for the claim or asset is based on an issue-specific\nrating; and\n(b) the ECRA that determined the rating had taken the technique\ninto consideration in doing so.\npage 182 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.5\n(4) A transaction in which CRM techniques are used must not receive a\nhigher capital requirement than an otherwise identical transaction in\nwhich no such technique is used.\n4.6.5 Use of 2 or more CRM techniques for 1 exposure etc\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm has an exposure that is covered\nby 2 or more CRM techniques (for example, the exposure is covered\nby both eligible collateral and an eligible guarantee), the firm must\ndivide the exposure into parts covered by each technique (for\nexample, the part covered by the collateral, and the part covered by\nthe guarantee) and must calculate the risk-weighted assets for each\npart separately.\n(2) If credit protection provided for an exposure by a single protection\nprovider has 2 or more maturities, the exposure must be divided into\nseparate parts for each maturity.\nDivision 4.6.B Collateral\nSubdivision 4.6.B.1 General\n4.6.6 Capital relief from collateral\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may obtain capital relief by\naccepting Shari’a-compliant eligible collateral.\nNote The capital relief that an Islamic banking business firm obtains from\ncollateral is calculated by either the simple approach (see\nSubdivision 4.6.B.2) or the comprehensive approach (see\nSubdivision 4.6.B.3). The meaning of eligible collateral differs between\nthe simple approach and the comprehensive approach — see respectively\nrule 4.6.12 and rule 4.6.16.\n(2) Collateral may be lodged by the firm’s counterparty, or by a third\nparty on behalf of the counterparty.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 183\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.7\n(3) The firm must enter into a written agreement with the party lodging\nthe collateral. The agreement must establish the firm’s direct, explicit,\nirrevocable and unconditional recourse to the collateral.\nGuidance\nIn the case of cash collateral, the recourse may be in the form of a contractual right\nof set-off on credit balances. A common-law right of set-off is, on its own,\ninsufficient to satisfy this rule.\n(4) If collateral is lodged by a third party, the third party must guarantee\nthe counterparty’s obligation to the firm and must indemnify the firm\nif the counterparty fails to fulfil its obligation. The firm must ensure\nthat the guarantee does not fail for lack of consideration.\n(5) The mechanism by which collateral is lodged must allow the firm to\nliquidate or take possession of the collateral in a timely way. The firm\nmust take all steps necessary to satisfy the legal requirements\napplicable to its interest in the collateral.\nGuidance\n1 The firm should have clear and robust procedures for the liquidation of\ncollateral to ensure that the legal conditions for declaring default and\nliquidating the collateral are observed.\n2 The firm should consider whether, in the event of default, notice to the party\nthat lodged the collateral would be needed before the firm could have recourse\nto it.\n(6) There must not be a significant positive correlation between the value\nof the collateral and the credit quality of the borrower.\nNote A positive correlation between the credit quality of the borrower and the\nvalue of the collateral is often called “wrong-way risk”.\n4.6.7 Valuing collateral\nCollateral accepted by an Islamic banking business firm must be\nvalued at its net realisable value, taking into account prevailing\nmarket conditions. That value must be monitored at appropriate\nintervals, and the collateral must be regularly revalued.\nGuidance\n1 The net realisable value of some collateral may be readily available (for\nexample, collateral that is marked-to-market regularly).

For example:\n• securities accepted as collateral are usually marked-to-market daily\nwhile physical assets that are accepted as eligible collateral are valued\nless often\n• commercial property might be valued every year while residential\nproperty might not need to be valued as often.\n4.6.8 Holding eligible collateral\n(1) Eligible collateral must be held by:\n(a) the Islamic banking business firm concerned;\n(b) a branch (in or outside the QFC) of the firm;\n(c) another member of the firm’s corporate group;\n(d) an independent custodian; or\n(e) a central counterparty.\n(2) The holder of cash collateral in the form of a certificate of deposit or\nbank bill issued by an Islamic banking business firm must keep\npossession of the instrument while the collateralised exposure exists.\n(3) If the collateral is held by an independent custodian or central\ncounterparty, the firm must take reasonable steps to ensure that the\nholder segregates the collateral from the holder’s own assets.\n(4) If collateral is held by a branch of an Islamic banking business firm\nand the branch is outside the QFC, the agreement between the firm\nand the party lodging the collateral must require the branch to act in\naccordance with the agreement.\n4.6.9 Approaches to risk weight using eligible collateral\n(1) When assigning risk weights to exposures that are collateralised by\neligible collateral, an Islamic banking business firm may use either of\nthe following approaches:\n(a) the simple approach (see Subdivision 4.6.B.2);\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 185\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.10\n(b) the comprehensive approach (see Subdivision 4.6.B.3).\n(2) However, the firm must apply the same approach for all of the\nexposures in its banking book that are collateralised by eligible\ncollateral.\n4.6.10 Definition for Division 4.6.B — core market participant\nIn this Division:\ncore market participant means any of the following:\n(a) the State of Qatar;\n(b) the Qatar Central Bank;\n(c) any other sovereign or central bank that qualifies for a 0% risk\nweight under Division 4.4.B;\n(d) a bank;\n(e) any other financial entity that is subject to capital or leverage\nrequirements and qualifies for a 20% risk weight under\nDivision 4.4.B;\nNote For example, a CCP, regulated mutual fund or regulated pension\nfund that is subject to capital or leverage requirements may qualify\nfor a 20% risk weight under Division 4.4.B.\n(g) a QCCP.\nSubdivision 4.6.B.2 Simple approach\nGuidance\nThe simple approach replaces the risk weight of the counterparty with the risk\nweight of the collateral (generally subject to a 20% minimum) for the collateralised\npart of the exposure.\n4.6.11 When simple approach may be applied\n(1) For the simple approach to be applied, the collateral must be lodged\nfor at least the life of the exposure, and must be marked to market at\nleast once a month.

The formula is in\nrule 4.6.24 (6).\n(3) In the case of a maturity mismatch, the value of the collateral must be\nadjusted in accordance with rule 4.6.25.\n(4) If the exposure and collateral are in different currencies, the firm must\napply an additional haircut to the volatility-adjusted collateral amount\nin accordance with rule 4.6.26 to take account of possible future\nfluctuations in exchange rates.\n(5) The effect of a netting agreement covering an SFT may be taken into\naccount in accordance with rule 4.6.27 and Division 4.6.E.\n4.6.16 Eligible collateral in comprehensive approach\nIn the comprehensive approach, the following instruments may be\ntreated as eligible collateral in addition to the instruments mentioned\nin rule 4.6.12:\n(a) equities and convertible sukuk that are not included in a main\nindex but are listed on a recognised exchange;\nNote For the list of recognised exchanges, see Schedule 1.\npage 192 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.17\n(b) units in UCITS and mutual funds that include the instruments\nreferred to in paragraph (a).\n4.6.17 When physical assets may be eligible collateral\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may accept as eligible collateral,\nby way of pledge, a specified asset that can be lawfully owned, and\nis saleable and deliverable. The pledge must be enforceable and the\nasset must be unencumbered.\nNote In an ijarah contract, the underlying asset is not eligible collateral for\npurposes of credit risk mitigation — see rule 4.5.6 (3).\n(2) The firm may accept a physical asset as eligible collateral only if:\n(a) either:\n(i) the firm legally owns the asset; or\nGuidance\nTherefore ijarah contracts are restricted to operating ijarah only,\nwhere the firm bears related costs of asset ownership.\n(ii) the asset attracts capital charges other than credit risk\nbefore the beginning of, and throughout, the financing\nperiod; and\nExamples\noperating ijarah\ninventories under murabahah\n(b) the asset meets the relevant criteria in rules 4.6.18 to 4.6.20; and\n(c) the firm complies with the conditions in rules 4.6.18 to 4.6.21.\n(3) A physical asset accepted as eligible collateral must be valued\ndepending on whether there is an active market for the asset.\n(4) If there is such a market, the asset must be valued at least once a\nmonth. If there is no active market for the asset, it must be valued:\n(a) each time there is a significant change in the market in which\nthe asset operates; and\n(b) each time there is a significant change in the condition of the\nasset.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 193\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.18\n4.6.18 When physical assets may be eligible collateral — real\nestate\n(1) This rule sets out the conditions under which an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm may recognise real estate as eligible collateral in the\ncomprehensive approach, including the criteria that such collateral\nmust satisfy.\n(2) The risk of the obligor must not be materially dependent upon the\nperformance of the underlying property or project, but rather on the\nunderlying capacity of the obligor to repay the debt from other\nsources. Repayment of the facility must not be materially dependent\non cash flow generated by the collateral.\n(3) The value of the collateral must not be materially dependent on the\nperformance of the obligor.\nGuidance\nThis requirement is not intended to apply to situations where purely macro-\neconomic factors affect both the value of the collateral and the performance of the\nobligor.\n(4) The collateral must meet the following requirements:\n(a) any claim on the collateral must be legally enforceable in all the\nrelevant jurisdictions, and any claim on the collateral must be\nproperly filed on a timely basis;\n(b) the firm’s interest must be a perfected lien (that is, all legal\nrequirements for establishing the claim must have been\nfulfilled);\n(c) the collateral agreement and the legal process underpinning it\nmust provide for the firm to realise the value of the collateral\nwithin a reasonable timeframe;\n(d) the collateral must be valued at or less than the current fair value\nunder which the property could be sold under private contract\nbetween a willing seller and an arm’s-length buyer on the date\nof valuation;\npage 194 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.18\n(e) a junior lien may be taken into account if there is no doubt that\nthe claim is legally enforceable and constitutes an efficient\ncredit risk mitigant.\n(5) In the case of a junior lien, the firm may use only the residual value\nafter taking into account the collateral haircut.\nGuidance\nIn this case, residual value is derived after deducting exposures with other pledgees,\nusing approved limits or total outstanding amount of the exposures with other\npledgees whichever is higher.\n(6) The firm must monitor the value of the collateral frequently (at least\nannually).\nGuidance\n1 More frequent monitoring is suggested where the market is subject to\nsignificant changes in conditions.\n2 Acceptable statistical methods of evaluation (for example reference to house\nprice indices, sampling) may be used to update estimates or to identify\ncollateral that may have declined in value and that may need re-appraisal.\n3 A qualified professional must evaluate the property when there is reason to\nbelieve that the value of the collateral may have declined materially relative\nto general market prices or when a credit event, such as default, occurs.\n(7) The firm must also meet the following management requirements:\n(a) it must clearly document the types of collateral that it accepts,\nand its financing policies when this type of collateral is taken;\n(b) it must take steps to ensure that property taken as collateral is\nadequately insured against damage or deterioration;\n(c) it must continuously monitor the extent of any permissible prior\nclaims (for example tax) on the property; and\n(d) it must appropriately monitor the risk of environmental liability\narising in respect of the collateral, such as the presence of toxic\nmaterial on a property.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 195\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.19\n4.6.19 When physical assets may be eligible collateral — other\nphysical assets\n(1) This rule sets out the conditions under which an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm may recognise physical collateral (other than real\nestate) as eligible collateral in the comprehensive approach, including\nthe criteria that such collateral must satisfy.\n(2) There must be a liquid market for the disposal of the collateral in an\nexpeditious and economically efficient manner.\n(3) There must be well established, publicly available market prices for\nthe collateral.\n(4) The firm must comply with the operational requirements set out in\nrules 4.6.18 (6) and (7) as if those requirements applied to assets that\nare not real estate.\n(5) The firm’s claim over the collateral must be a first lien on, or charge\nover, the collateral.\n(6) The financing agreement must include a detailed description of the\ncollateral and detailed specifications of the manner and frequency of\nits revaluation.\n(7) The firm must also meet the following management requirements:\n(a) its internal credit policies must clearly document the types of\nphysical collateral that it accepts and its policies and practices\nin relation to the appropriate amount of each type of collateral\nrelative to the exposure amount;\n(b) that documentation must be available for examination and audit\nreview;\n(c) the firm’s credit policies must address appropriate collateral\nrequirements in relation to:\n(i) the exposure amount;\n(ii) the ability to liquidate the collateral readily;\n(iii) the ability to objectively establish a price or market value;\npage 196 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.20\n(iv) the frequency with which the value can readily be obtained\n(including a professional appraisal or valuation), and\n(v) the volatility of the collateral’s value;\n(d) the periodic revaluation process must pay particular attention to\n“fashion-sensitive” collateral to ensure that valuations are\nappropriately adjusted downward for fashion, or model-year,\nobsolescence as well as physical obsolescence or deterioration;\nand\n(e) in the case of inventory (for example raw materials, finished\ngoods, dealers’ inventories of vehicles) and equipment, the\nperiodic revaluation process must include physical inspection of\nthe collateral.\n4.6.20 When physical assets may be eligible collateral — leased\nassets\n(1) This rule sets out the conditions under which an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm may recognise a leased asset (that is, an asset used in\noperating ijarah or IMB) as eligible collateral under the\ncomprehensive approach.\n(2) The asset must comply with the relevant requirements of rules 4.6.18\nand 4.6.19.\n(3) The firm as lessor must exercise robust risk management in relation\nto the location of the asset, the use to which it is put, its age, and\nplanned obsolescence.\n(4) There must be a robust legal framework establishing the lessor’s legal\nownership of the asset and its ability to exercise its rights as owner in\na timely manner.\n(5) The difference between the rate of depreciation of the asset and the\nrate of amortisation of the lease payments must not be so large as to\noverstate the CRM attributed to the asset.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 197\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.21\n4.6.21 When physical assets may be eligible collateral —\ngeneral conditions in relation to firm’s management of\ncollateral\n(1) This rule sets out further conditions (in relation to the management of\ncollateral) under which an Islamic banking business firm may\nrecognise a physical asset as eligible collateral under the\ncomprehensive approach.\n(2) The firm must collect and retain the relevant data about revaluation\nand disposal of physical assets as a means to recover from delinquent\nor defaulted exposures, particularly data on disposal amount and\ntimeline of disposal of the physical assets and the costs incurred for\nthe disposal.\n(3) The firm must use the data to verify, at least annually, the\nappropriateness of the minimum 30% haircut on physical assets. The\nfirm must apply a greater haircut if their data on the disposal of\nphysical assets shows losses of more than the 30% haircut.\n(4) The firm must conduct an independent review to find out whether it\ncomplies with the requirements of these rules in relation to\nrecognising physical collateral as a credit risk mitigant.

Collateral is\nilliquid if there is no continuously active market in which a\ncounterparty would, within 2 days or less, obtain multiple price\nquotations that would not move the market or reflect a market\ndiscount.\nGuidance\nExamples of collateral that would be considered illiquid include:\n• collateral that is not marked to market daily\n• collateral that is subject to a particular accounting treatment for valuation\npurposes (for example, SFTs referencing securities whose fair value is\ndetermined by models with inputs that are not observed in the market).\n(5) If on a particular netting set, over the previous 2 quarters, a banking\nbusiness firm has experienced more than 2 margin call disputes that\nhave lasted longer than the firm’s estimate of the margin period of\nrisk (that is, the period from the last exchange of collateral covering\nthe netting set with a defaulting counterparty until the counterparty is\npage 202 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.24\nclosed out and the resulting market risk is re-hedged) then, for the\nfollowing 2 quarters, the firm must use a minimum holding period\nthat is twice the period that would apply except for this subrule.\n(6) When remargining or revaluation is undertaken less frequently than\nthe minimum specified in table 4.6.24, the haircut that must be\napplied is:\n𝑁 +(𝑇 −1)\n𝑅 𝑀\n𝐻 = 𝐻 √\n+ M T\n𝑀\nwhere:\nH is the haircut to be applied.\n+\nH is the haircut under the minimum holding period.\nM\nN is the actual number of business days between remarginings (for\nR\ncapital market transactions) or revaluations (for secured transactions).\nT is the minimum holding period for transactions of that type, as set\nM\nout in table 4.6.24.\n(7) However, the firm may apply a haircut of 0% to an SFT with a core\nmarket participant, if the transaction satisfies all of the conditions in\nrule 4.6.13 (5).\n4.6.25 Treatment of maturity mismatches\n(1) A maturity mismatch exists between an exposure and its credit risk\nmitigation if the residual maturity of the term of lodgement of the\ncredit risk mitigation is shorter than the maturity of the exposure.\n(2) The maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the credit risk\nmitigation must both be defined conservatively. The effective\nmaturity of the underlying must be taken to be the longest possible\nremaining time before the counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its\nobligation, taking into account any applicable grace period. For the\ncredit risk mitigation, embedded options that may reduce the term of\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 203\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.25\nthe credit risk mitigation must be taken into account so that the\nshortest possible effective maturity is used.\nGuidance\nFor example: if, in the case of an SCHI, the protection seller has a call option, the\nmaturity is the first call date. Likewise, if the protection buyer owns the call option\nand has a strong incentive to call the transaction at the first call date, for example\nbecause of a step-up in cost from that date on, the effective maturity is the remaining\ntime to the first call date.\n(3) If there is a maturity mismatch, the credit risk mitigation may be\nrecognised only if the original maturity of its term of lodgement is\n12 months or longer, and its residual maturity is 3 months or longer.\n(4) For the purpose of determining the maturity of the exposure and credit\nrisk mitigation:\n(a) for the exposure, the effective maturity is taken to be the longest\npossible remaining time before the counterparty must fulfil its\nobligation; and\n(b) for the credit risk mitigation, the Islamic banking business firm\nconcerned must take into account any provision or incentive\nwithin the documentation for the transaction that could reduce\nthe term of the credit risk mitigation, so that the shortest possible\neffective maturity is used.\n(5) If there is a maturity mismatch, the firm must adjust the value of the\ncredit risk mitigation as follows:\n𝑡 −0.25\n𝑃 = 𝑃 ×\n𝑎 𝑇−0.25\nwhere:\nP is the value of the credit risk mitigation, adjusted for the maturity\na\nmismatch.\nP is the value of the credit risk mitigation after adjustment for any\nhaircuts.\nt is min {T, residual maturity of the credit risk mitigation\narrangement}, in years.\nT is min {5 years, residual maturity of the exposure}, in years.\npage 204 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.26\n4.6.26 Treatment of currency mismatches\n(1) A currency mismatch exists between an exposure and its credit risk\nmitigation if the credit risk mitigation is denominated in a different\ncurrency from the one in which the exposure is denominated.

H is 1% [(101-100)/100]\nand f is 4% (from table 4.6.28). Therefore, the SFT in question must be\ntreated as an unsecured financing to the counterparty.\n(b) for a single collateral-for-collateral SFT, lending collateral A\nand receiving collateral B, H is still the amount of collateral\nreceived but the effective minimum of the transaction f must\nintegrate the minima of both types of collateral and must be\ncalculated by the formula:\n1+𝑓\n𝐵\n𝑓 = −1\n1+𝑓\n𝐴\nand then compared to the effective haircut of the transaction,\ncalculated by the formula\n𝐶𝐵\n−1.\n𝐶𝐴\nGuidance\nFor example, consider an in-scope SFT where 102 of a corporate debt\nsecurity with a 10-year maturity is exchanged against 104 of equity, the\neffective haircut H of the transaction is (104/102 – 1 = 1.96% which must be\ncompared with the effective minimum f of 1.06/1.03 – 1 = 2.91%. Therefore,\nthe SFT in question must be treated as an unsecured financing to the\ncounterparty.\n(4) For a netting set of SFTs, the formula for the effective “portfolio”\nminimum for the transaction is:\n𝑓 = [(\n∑𝑠𝐸𝑠\n)/(\n∑𝑡𝐶𝑡\n)] - 1\n𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑜\n∑𝑠𝐸𝑠 𝑥 ( 1+𝑓𝑠) ∑𝑡𝐶𝑡 𝑥 ( 1+𝑓𝑡)\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 209\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.28\nwhere:\nE is the net position in each security (or cash) that is net lent.\ns\nC isthe net position that is net borrowed.\nt\nf and f are the respective haircut minima for the securities that are\ns t\nnet lent and net borrowed.\n(5) The result of the calculation in subrule (4) is the weighted average\nminimum of the portfolio. The portfolio haircut does not breach the\nminimum if:\n∑𝐶 −∑𝐸\n𝑡 𝑠\n≥ 𝑓\n∑𝐸 𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑜\n𝑠\n(6) If the portfolio haircut is below the minimum, then the netting set of\nSFTs must be treated as an unsecured financing to the counterparty.\nThat treatment must be applied to all trades in which:\n(a) the security received appears in table 4.6.28; and\n(b) within the netting set, the firm is a net receiver of that security.\n(7) For the purposes of the calculation, collateral that is called by either\ncounterparty can be treated as collateral received from the moment\nthat it is called (that is, the treatment is independent of the settlement\nperiod).\nGuidance\nThe following portfolio of trades gives an example of how this method works (it\nshows a portfolio that does not breach the minimum).\nActual trades Cash Sovere Collateral A Collat\nign eral B\ndebt\nMinimum (fs) 0% 0% 6% 10%\nPortfolio of trades 50 100 -400 250\nEs 50 100 0 250\nCt 0 0 400 0\nfportfolio -0.0024\n∑𝐶 −∑𝐸 0\n𝑡 𝑠\n∑𝐸\n𝑠\npage 210 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.30\nDivision 4.6.C Guarantees\n4.6.30 Capital relief from guarantees\n(1) A guarantee reduces an Islamic banking business firm’s credit risk\ncapital requirement in relation to an exposure only if:\n(a) the guarantor is an eligible guarantor (see rule 4.6.31);\n(b) the guarantee is an eligible guarantee (see rule 4.6.32); and\n(c) an unsecured exposure to the guarantor would be assigned a\nlower risk weight than an unsecured exposure to the\ncounterparty.\n(2) Before accepting a guarantee, an Islamic banking business firm must\nconsider the guarantor’s legal and financial ability to fulfil the\nguarantee.\n4.6.31 Eligible guarantors\nEach of the following is an eligible guarantor:\n(a) the State of Qatar or any other sovereign;\n(b) a PSE or MDB;\n(c) a bank, securities firm or other financial institution that is\nprudentially regulated to a standard similar to that applied by the\nRegulatory Authority;\n(d) if the relevant exposure is a securitisation exposure — an\nexternally-rated entity (including a parent, subsidiary or affiliate\nof the obligor) that is rated BBB- or better and was rated A- or\nbetter when the guarantee was given;\n(e) if the relevant exposure is not a securitisation exposure — any\nexternally-rated entity, including a parent, subsidiary or affiliate\nof the obligor.\n4.6.32 What is an eligible guarantee?\n(1) A guarantee is an eligible guarantee if it satisfies subrules (2) to (10).\n(2) The guarantor is an eligible guarantor.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 211\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.32\n(3) The guarantee is explicitly documented.\n(4) The guarantee is a direct claim on the guarantor and clearly states the\nextent of the cover.

If\nthe firm would be required to transfer the underlying exposure to the\nissuer for settlement, the terms of the exposure must provide that any\nrequired consent to the transfer may not be unreasonably withheld.\n(16) First-to-default and all other nth-to-default credit SCHIs are not\neligible SCHIs.\nGuidance\nIn transactions in which a banking business firm provides credit protection through\nsuch instruments, it must apply the treatment described in Part 4.6A.\n4.6.40 Risk-weighting of exposures covered by eligible SCHIs\n(1) If an exposure is fully covered by an eligible SCHI, the exposure may\nbe assigned the risk weight that would be assigned to an unsecured\nexposure to the issuer under Division 4.4.B.\n(2) If an exposure is partly covered by an eligible SCHI:\n(a) the covered part must be assigned the risk weight that would be\nassigned to an unsecured exposure to the issuer under\nDivision 4.4.B; and\n(b) the remainder must be assigned the risk weight that would be\nassigned to an unsecured exposure to the counterparty under that\nDivision.\nNote If the SCHI provides for a materiality threshold (below which the issuer\nis not obliged to pay in the event of a loss), the part of the exposure that\nis below the threshold must be deducted from CET 1 capital — see rule\n3.2.40.\n(3) If the SCHI provides that the Islamic banking business firm\nconcerned and the issuer must share any loss, the firm:\n(a) may treat, as covered by an eligible SCHI, a proportion of the\nexposure equal to the protected portion; and\n(b) must treat the remainder of the exposure as unsecured.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 219\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.41\n(4) If the SCHI covers payment of principal only, profit and other\nuncovered payments must be treated as unsecured.\n(5) If:\n(a) an Islamic banking business firm transfers part (but not all) of\nthe risk of an exposure in 1 or more tranches to 1 or more\nprotection sellers; and\n(b) the risk transferred and the risk retained are of different\nseniority;\nthe firm may obtain credit protection for either the second-loss\nportion or the first-loss portion. The firm is to be treated as having\nsecuritised the exposure, and must calculate the relevant capital\nrequirement in accordance with Chapter 10.\n4.6.41 Partial recognition of SCHIs when application of\nforbearance to underlying not covered\n(1) If an SCHI does not cover the application of forbearance to the\nunderlying obligation, but the SCHI otherwise meets the\nrequirements in rule 4.6.39, the Islamic banking business firm\nconcerned may recognise the SCHI, for the purpose of reducing its\ncredit risk capital requirement, to the extent allowed by this rule.\n(2) If the amount of the SCHI is less than or equal to that of the amount\nof the underlying obligation, the firm may treat, as covered, so much\nof the obligation as equals 60% of the amount of the hedge.\nGuidance\nFor example. if the amount of the obligation is 100, and the hedge is 80, the firm\nmay treat (60% × 80 = 48) of the obligation as covered.\n(3) If the amount of the SCHI is more than that of the underlying\nobligation, the firm may treat no more than 60% of the amount of the\nobligation as covered.\nGuidance\nFor example. if the amount of the obligation is 100, and the hedge is 120, the firm\nmay treat (60% × 100 = 60) of the obligation as covered.\npage 220 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.42\n4.6.42 Treatment of maturity mismatches\n(1) A maturity mismatch between an exposure and the relevant credit\nprotection exists if the residual maturity of the credit protection is\nshorter than the maturity of the exposure.\n(2) If there is a maturity mismatch, the credit protection may be\nrecognised only if its original maturity is 12 months or longer, and its\nresidual maturity is 3 months or longer.\n(3) For the purpose of determining the maturity of the exposure and credit\nprotection:\n(a) for the exposure, the effective maturity is taken to be the longest\npossible remaining time before the counterparty must fulfil its\nobligation; and\n(b) for the credit protection, the Islamic banking business firm\nconcerned must take into account any provision or incentive\nwithin the documentation that could reduce the term of the\nprotection, so that the shortest possible effective maturity is\nused.\n(4) If there is a maturity mismatch, the firm must adjust the value of the\ncredit protection as follows:\n𝑡 −0.25\n𝑃 = 𝑃 ×\n𝑎 𝑇−0.25\nwhere:\nP is the value of the protection, adjusted for the maturity mismatch.\na\nP is the value of the protection after adjustment for any haircuts.\nt is min {T, residual maturity of the protection}, in years.\nT is min {5 years, residual maturity of the exposure}, in years.\n4.6.43 Treatment of currency mismatches\n(1) A currency mismatch exists between an exposure and the relevant\ncredit protection if the instrument and the exposure are denominated\nin different currencies.

The firm must not selectively pick which transactions to\nnet.\n4.6.47 Transactions not covered by appropriate legal opinion\nnot to be netted\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must ensure that a transaction is\nnot netted unless the transaction is covered by a legal opinion that\nsatisfies rule 4.6.48.\n(2) In calculating the net sum due to or from a counterparty, the firm must\nexclude any netted transaction for which it has not obtained a legal\nopinion that satisfies rule 4.6.48 and applies to the relevant\njurisdiction. The firm must report such a transaction on a gross basis.\n(3) The firm must report a transaction on a gross basis if:\n(a) there is any doubt about the enforceability of the relevant netting\nagreement; or\n(b) any legal development affects the agreement’s enforceability.\n4.6.48 Requirements with which legal opinions must comply\n(1) The requirements with which a legal opinion must comply are set out\nin subrules (2) and (3).\n(2) The opinion must conclude that, in the event of default, liquidation,\nbankruptcy or other similar circumstances of a party to the netting\nagreement, the Islamic banking business firm’s claims and\npage 224 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCredit risk mitigation Part 4.6\nRule 4.6.49\nobligations are limited to the net sum calculated under the netting\nagreement in accordance with the applicable law.\nGuidance\nThe Regulatory Authority expects the legal opinion to deal with the issue of which\nof the following laws applies to the netting:\n• the law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incorporated or formed\n(or, in the case of an individual, resides)\n• if an overseas branch of the counterparty is involved — the law of the\njurisdiction in which the branch is located\n• the law that governs the individual transactions\n• the law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to give effect to the\nnetting.\n(3) In particular, the opinion must conclude that, if the counterparty\nbecomes insolvent or enters into external administration, a liquidator\nor administrator of the counterparty will not be able to claim a gross\namount from the firm while being liable to pay only a dividend in\ninsolvency to the firm (as separate money flows).\nGuidance\nIn some countries, there is provision for the appointment of an administrator to a\ntroubled bank. Under those provisions, the appointment of an administrator might\nnot constitute a ground for triggering a netting agreement. Such provisions do not\nprevent the recognition of a netting agreement under this Division if the agreement\ncan still take effect despite the bank under administration not meeting its obligations\nas they fall due.\n4.6.49 Firm’s use of legal opinions\n(1) Before an Islamic banking business firm uses a legal opinion to\nsupport a netting agreement, the firm:\n(a) must ensure that none of the assumptions on which the opinion\nis based, nor any qualification or reservation to which it is\nsubject, is unduly restrictive;\n(b) must review the assumptions about the enforceability of the\nagreement, and must ensure that they are specific and factual,\nand are adequately explained in the opinion; and\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 225\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6 Credit risk mitigation\nRule 4.6.50\n(c) must review and assess the assumptions, qualifications and\nomissions in the opinion to determine whether they give rise to\nany doubt about the enforceability of the agreement.\n(2) The firm must have procedures to monitor legal developments and to\nensure that its netting agreements continue to be enforceable. The\nfirm must update the relevant legal opinions, as necessary, to ensure\nthat the firm continues to have the sound basis referred to in\nrule 4.6.53 (1) (b).\n(3) The firm may rely on a legal opinion obtained on a group basis by\nanother member of its corporate group if the firm and the other\nmember have satisfied themselves that the opinion applies to a netting\nagreement to which the firm is a counterparty.\n4.6.50 Relying on general legal opinions\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may rely on a general legal opinion\nabout the enforceability of netting agreements in a particular\njurisdiction if the firm is satisfied that the type of netting agreement\nis covered by the opinion.\n(2) The firm must satisfy itself that the netting agreement with a\ncounterparty and the general legal opinion are applicable to each\ntransaction and product type undertaken with the counterparty, and in\nall jurisdictions where those transactions are originated.\n4.6.51 Netting of positions across books\nAn Islamic banking business firm may net positions across its\nbanking book and trading book only if:\n(a) the netted transactions are marked to market daily;

In such a transaction, if either party defaults\nat a time when the transaction has a positive economic value to the\nother party, a loss to the other party results.\n(3) The exposure to credit risk through a financing is one-sided — only\nthe lender faces the risk of loss. For the kinds of transaction that create\ncounterparty credit risk, the market value of a transaction varies over\ntime with the movement of underlying market factors, and at a\nparticular time can be positive or negative to either party.\n(4) Therefore, both parties to such a transaction face a risk of loss.\nExamples\n1 A bank provides a financing to a borrower and receives collateral from the\nborrower.\n• The borrower is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults and does not\nreturn the collateral. Even in cases where the customer has the legal right\nto offset the amount it owes on the financing in compensation for the\nlost collateral, the customer is still exposed to the risk of loss at the\noutset of the financing because the value of the financing may be less\nthan the value of the collateral the time of default of the bank.\n2 A bank borrows cash from a counterparty and posts collateral to the\ncounterparty (or undertakes a transaction that is economically equivalent, such\nas the sale and repurchase (repo) of a security).\n• The bank is exposed to the risk that its counterparty defaults and does\nnot return the collateral that the bank posted.\n• The counterparty is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults and the\namount the counterparty raises from the sale of the collateral that the\npage 230 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCounterparty credit risk Part 4.6A\nRule 4.6A.2\nbank posted is insufficient to cover the loss on the counterparty’s\nfinancing to the bank.\n3 A bank borrows a security from a counterparty and posts cash to the\ncounterparty as collateral (or undertakes a transaction that is economically\nequivalent, such as a reverse repo).\n• The bank is exposed to the risk that its counterparty defaults and does\nnot return the cash that the bank posted as collateral.\n• The counterparty is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults and the\ncash that the bank posted as collateral is insufficient to cover the loss of\nthe security that the bank borrowed.\n4 A bank enters a transaction in an SCHI with a counterparty (for example, it\nenters a swap transaction or purchases an option). The value of the transaction\nmay vary over time with the movement of underlying market factors.\n• The bank is exposed to the risk that the counterparty defaults when the\nSCHI has a positive value for the bank.\n• The counterparty is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults when the\nSCHI has a positive value for the counterparty.\n4.6A.2 Transactions that Part 4.6A applies to\n(1) This Part applies to transactions of the following kinds, whether in\nthe banking book or the trading book, and whether or not settled in\ncash:\n(a) OTC transactions in SCHIs;\n(b) exchange-traded SCHIs;\n(c) long settlement transactions;\n(d) SFTs.\nGuidance\n1 The transactions referred to in subrule (1) generally have the following\ncharacteristics:\n• they generate a current exposure or market value\n• their future market value is uncertain or unknown, but is affected by\nmarket variables\n• they generate an exchange of future payments, or an exchange of a\nfinancial instrument (or commodities) against payment\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 231\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6A Counterparty credit risk\nRule 4.6A.3\n• they are with an identified counterparty for which a unique probability\nof default can be determined.\n2 Those transactions often have the following characteristics also:\n• collateral may be used to mitigate the risk exposure and is inherent in\nsome transactions\n• short-term financing may be a main purpose, in that the transactions\nmostly consist of an exchange of one asset (cash or securities) for\nanother for a relatively short period, usually for the business purpose of\nfinancing; the two sides of the transactions are not the result of separate\ndecisions but form an indivisible whole for a particular purpose\n• netting may be used to mitigate the risk\n• positions are frequently valued (most commonly daily), according to\nmarket variables\n• remargining may be employed.\nNote Long settlement transaction and SFT (securities financing transaction)\nare defined in the glossary.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm must calculate counterparty credit\nrisk charges for:\n(a) all bilateral transactions (see Division 4.6A.B);\n(b) all centrally cleared transactions (see Division 4.6A.C); and\n(c) default fund contributions to QCCPs (see Division 4.6A.D), if\nany.\n4.6A.3 Capital requirements for counterparty credit risk\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm that engages in certain classes of\ntransactions that expose it to counterparty credit risk must hold\nsufficient regulatory capital to cover the counterparty credit risk that\narises from those transactions.\npage 232 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCounterparty credit risk Part 4.6A\nRule 4.6A.4\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm’s capital requirement for\ncounterparty credit risk is made up of the following:\n(a) the firm’s risk-weighted assets for counterparty credit risk,\nwhich is the sum of the following:\n(i) the firm’s risk-weighted assets representing credit\nexposures for counterparty credit default risk (“default risk\nRWA”);\n(ii) the firm’s risk-weighted assets representing credit\nexposures for counterparty credit default risk arising from\ntrade exposures to a CCP (“trade exposure RWA”); and\n(iii) the firm’s risk-weighted assets representing credit\nexposure arising from a default fund contribution to a non-\nqualifying CCP (“default fund RWA”);\n(b) any applicable credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk capital\ncharge;\n(c) any applicable default fund capital charge for any default fund\ncontributions to a QCCP.\nNote The amount of the firm’s total risk-weighted assets for counterparty\ncredit risk is part of the amount of its total risk-weighted assets for credit\nrisk (see rule 4.1.4). The firm’s total risk-weighted assets for credit risk\nis its credit risk capital requirement, which is part of its risk-based capital\nrequirement (see rule 3.2.5).\n4.6A.4 Policies — foreign exchange rollovers\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must have policies for entering into\nand monitoring rollovers on foreign exchange transactions. The\npolicies must restrict the firm’s capacity to enter into such rollovers,\nand must have been approved by the Regulatory Authority.\n(2) The firm must notify the Authority if it enters into a rollover outside\nthe approved policy.

If the stated notional amount of a contract is leveraged or\nenhanced by the structure of the transaction, the firm must use the\neffective notional amount when calculating PFE.\n(3) No PFE is calculated for single currency floating/floating interest rate\nswaps because the credit exposure on such contracts must be\nevaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market values.\n(4) For contracts that are structured to settle outstanding exposures\nfollowing specified payment dates on which the terms are reset (so\nthat the mark-to-market value of the contract is zero on the specified\ndates), the residual maturity must be set equal to the time until the\nnext reset date. In the case of interest rate contracts with those features\nand a remaining maturity of more than 1 year, the CCF is subject to a\nminimum of 0.5% even if there are reset dates of a shorter maturity.\nGuidance\nFor example, a principal resetting cross-currency swap or a settled-to-market SCHI\nwhere, at the next reset date, the outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are\nreset so that the fair value of the contract is zero. An SCHI contract with a\nmandatory break (where there is a legal contractual obligation on both parties to\nterminate the transaction by the mandatory break date) would also be eligible where\nthe outstanding exposure is settled completely.\n(5) For a contract with 2 or more exchanges of principal, the CCF must\nbe multiplied by the number of exchanges of principal still to be\nmade.\n4.6A.11 CCFs for items with terms subject to reset\n(1) For an item that is structured to settle outstanding exposures after\nspecified payment dates on which the terms are reset (that is, the\nmarked to market value of the item becomes zero on the specified\ndates), the period to the next reset date must be taken to be the item’s\nresidual maturity.\npage 240 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nCounterparty credit risk Part 4.6A\nRule 4.6A.12\n(2) For an interest rate item of that kind that is taken to have a residual\nmaturity of more than 1 year, the CCF to be applied must not be less\nthan 0.5% even if there are reset dates of a shorter maturity.\n(3) For an item with 2 or more exchanges of principal, the CCF must be\nmultiplied by the number of remaining exchanges under the item.\n4.6A.12 Calculating PFE — transactions covered by eligible\nadj\nbilateral netting agreements\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must recognise the effects of an\neligible bilateral netting agreement on its potential future credit\nexposure by applying the following formula to produce an adjusted\nadd-on amount for PFE on all contracts subject to the netting\nagreement:\n𝑃𝐹𝐸 = 0.4 (𝑃𝐹𝐸 )+0.6 (𝑁𝐺𝑅×𝑃𝐹𝐸 )\n𝑎𝑑𝑗 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠\nNote In relation to how eligible netting agreements may be applied for the\npurposes of this Division, see Subdivision 4.6.E.1.\n(2) PFE is the sum of the firm’s potential future credit exposures for\ngross\neach transaction covered by a netting agreement (except transactions\ncovered by the definition of NCCE in subrule 4.6A.9 (4)) as if no\nnetting would occur. PFE for each transaction is calculated by\nmultiplying the notional principal amount of the transaction by the\nappropriate CCF for that transaction set out in table 4.6A.10.\n(3) To calculate PFE , a banking business firm may treat matching\ngross\ntransactions included in a netting agreement as a single transaction\nwith a notional principal equal to the net receipts on the transactions.\nGuidance\nFor that purpose, matching transactions are forward foreign exchange transactions\nand other similar market-related transactions in which the notional principal is\nequivalent to a cash flow, if the cash flows fall due on the same value date and are\nin the same currency.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 241\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.6A Counterparty credit risk\nRule 4.6A.13\n4.6A.13 Calculating PFE — transactions covered by eligible\nadj\nbilateral netting agreements — net to gross ratio\n(1) The net to gross ratio (NGR) is the ratio of the net current exposure\nof all the transactions covered by an eligible bilateral netting\nagreement to the gross current credit exposure (GCCE) of those\ntransactions. GCCE for such a netting agreement is the sum of the\nmark-to-market values of all the transactions covered by the\nagreement (except transactions covered by the definition of NCCE in\nsubrule 4.6A.9(4)) with a positive mark-to-market value, with no\noffsetting against contracts with a negative mark-to-market value.\nNote In relation to how eligible netting agreements may be applied for the\npurposes of this Division, see Subdivision 4.6.E.1.\n(2) NGR reflects the risk-reducing portfolio effects of netted transactions\nin relation to current credit exposure:\n𝑁𝐶𝐶𝐸\n𝑁𝐺𝑅 =\n𝐺𝐶𝐶𝐸\n(3) NGR may be calculated either counterparty-by-counterparty or in the\naggregate.\n(4) An Islamic banking business firm must consistently use either the\ncounterparty-by-counterparty approach or the aggregate approach to\ncalculate NGR¸ and must notify the Regulatory Authority of the\napproach that it intends to use.\n(5) In the counterparty-by-counterparty approach, a unique NGR is\napplied to each counterparty to calculate the CEA of transactions with\nthat counterparty. NGR is the NCCE of all transactions with an\nindividual counterparty covered by an eligible bilateral netting\nagreement (that is, NCCE ) divided by the GCCE of all the\nindividual\ntransactions with that counterparty covered by the netting agreement\n(that is, GCCE ).\nindividual\n(6) In the aggregate approach, a single NGR is calculated and applied to\nall counterparties to calculate CEA for transactions with each of those\ncounterparties.

In\nmaking the assessment, the Authority takes into account any observed\nconcentration in the CRM techniques used by firms and the potential effect on\nthe efficacy of those techniques in reducing loss. The Authority would\nconsider the adequacy of provisions for a firm (and the industry in general) in\nthe light of the assessment.\n3 The Authority might seek the opinion of external experts in assessing the\nadequacy of a firm’s policies for grading and classifying its assets and the\nappropriateness and robustness of the levels of its provisions.\n4.7.8 Write-downs and write-offs — defaulted exposures\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm is satisfied that payment of a\ndefaulted exposure is unlikely, the firm must write the exposure off\nin whole or in part, in accordance with the applicable accounting\nstandard.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm must have appropriate policies and\nprocedures in relation to the writing off of defaulted exposures. In\nparticular, the policies must provide for such exposures to be written\noff within a period approved by the Regulatory Authority.\n4.7.9 Writing down value of collateral\nIf an Islamic banking business firm has taken possession of collateral\nbut has not realised it, the firm must write down the value of the\ncollateral over no longer than 5 years.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 269\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule 4.7.10\nDivision 4.7.B Classification of exposures\n4.7.10 Classification of exposures\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must classify the exposures in\nrelation to which this Part applies (except for the exposure classes\nmentioned in subrule (2)) as either performing or non-performing.\n(2) The excepted exposure classes are the following:\n(a) SCHIs;\n(b) exposures held in the firm’s trading book.\n(3) For this Part, an exposure is classified as performing if:\n(a) there is no uncertainty about the timely repayment of the\noutstanding amounts; and\n(b) it is currently in regular payment status with prompt payments.\n(4) For this Part, an exposure is classified as non-performing if any of\nthe following is true:\n(a) it is defaulted (see rule 4.4.80);\n(b) it is credit-impaired (that is, its valuation has been reduced\nbecause of a deterioration of its creditworthiness) according to\nthe applicable accounting standard;\n(c) it is a material exposure and is more than 90 days past due (see\nsubrule (5));\n(d) there is reason to believe that full repayment according to the\ncontractual terms is unlikely unless the firm realises collateral,\nwhether or not the exposure is current (and if it is not current,\nregardless of the number of days it is past due).\nExamples of circumstances in which full repayment according to the\ncontractual terms is unlikely\n• the firm concerned puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status\n• the firm makes a charge-off or account-specific provision resulting from\na material perceived decline in credit quality since the firm took on the\nexposure\npage 270 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nProblem assets and provisioning Part 4.7\nRule 4.7.11\n• the firm sells other credit obligations from the same counterparty at a\nmaterial credit-related economic loss\n• the firm applies a distressed forbearance to the credit obligation and this\nis likely to result in a diminished financial obligation because of material\nforgiveness, or postponement, of principal, profit or fees\n• the firm has filed for the counterparty’s bankruptcy or a similar order in\nrelation to the counterparty’s credit obligation to the firm\n• the counterparty has sought, or has been placed in, bankruptcy or similar\nprotection and as a result has avoided or delayed the repayment of the\nobligation.\n(5) For the purposes of this Part, an exposure is past due if any amount\ndue under the relevant contract (profit, principal, a fee or any other\namount) was not paid in full on the date when it was due. An exposure\nmust be treated as past due from the first day of missed payment, even\nif the amount of the exposure or the amount unpaid is not material.\n4.7.11 Application of classification to off-balance-sheet\nexposures\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must classify an off-balance-sheet\nexposure as non-performing if the firm has reason to believe that the\nfirm is unlikely to recoup, in a timely manner, the full amount that it\nmay be required to advance.\n(2) A commitment must be classified as non-performing if the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower has deteriorated to the extent that\nthe timely repayment in full by the borrower of any drawdown or\nassociated profit payments or fees is unlikely.\n4.7.12 Application of classification to exposures to SCHIs\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm considers it unlikely that it will\nreceive timely repayment, in full, of cash flow entitlements which are\nor will be due from a counterparty to a transaction in SCHIs, it must\nclassify such an exposure as non-performing.\n(2) For the purposes of measuring non-performance, the firm must\ncalculate its exposures to counterparties from SCHIs using the\nmodified current exposure method set out in Division 4.6A.B.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 271\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule 4.7.13\nPotential exposure add-ons applied in calculating such exposures\nmust reflect the nature of the individual facility involved.\nGuidance\nThe firm must regularly revalue its transaction exposures from SCHIs to maintain\nreasonably current assessments of the extent of credit risk attaching to those\ntransactions.\n4.7.13 Classification independent of accounting treatment\nThe classification of an exposure as performing or non-performing\nunder this Part does not affect its accounting treatment. Also, the\naccounting treatment of an exposure does not determine its\nclassification under this Part.\n4.7.14 Effect of collateral\n(1) When classifying an exposure, an Islamic banking business firm must\nnot treat collateral or other risk-mitigation arrangements as affecting\nthe classification of the exposure.\n(2) However, the firm may take collateral into account in assessing the\nborrower’s economic incentive to pay.\n(3) The firm must not treat the collateralisation of an exposure as\naffecting the exposure’s past-due status or the counting of past-due\ndays.\n(4) The firm must classify an exposure as non-performing for this Part if\nthe exposure satisfies the conditions for being so classified in\nrule 4.7.10 (4), even if the value of collateral held is more than the\namount of the past-due exposure.\n4.7.15 Level of application\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm has more than 1 exposure to a\nparticular non-retail counterparty, the firm must consider all of its\nexposures to that counterparty as non-performing if a material\nexposure to the counterparty is non-performing. That is, non-\nperforming status is applied to the counterparty.\npage 272 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nProblem assets and provisioning Part 4.7\nRule 4.7.16\n(2) In the case of an Islamic banking business firm’s exposure to a retail\ncounterparty, non-performing status is applied to the transaction.\nHowever, if the firm has more than 1 exposure to a particular retail\ncounterparty, the firm must, when deciding about the status of 1 such\nexposure, consider the status of the other exposures.\nGuidance\nQFC Islamic banking business firms are not permitted to undertake retail banking.\n(3) If an Islamic banking business firm has exposures to 2 or more\nmembers of a corporate group, the firm may apply non-performing\nstatus to each member. When the firm is deciding about the status of\nan exposure to such a member, the firm must take into account the\nstatus of its exposure to another member.\n4.7.16 Reclassification of non-performing exposures as\nperforming\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may reclassify a non-performing\nexposure as performing only if all of the following are true:\n(a) no exposure of the firm to the relevant counterparty is 90 days\nor more past due;\n(b) subject to subrule (2), the counterparty has made repayments\nwhen due over a continuous period of at least:\n(i) for a forborne exposure — 12 months (beginning on the\nfirst day on which a payment was due under the revised\nterms) (but see subrule (3)); or\n(ii) in any other case — 90 days;\n(c) the firm is satisfied, on the basis of an analysis of the\ncounterparty’s financial situation, that full and timely repayment\nof the exposure is likely (but see subrule (3));\n(d) the exposure is not classified as non-performing under rule\n4.7.10.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 273\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule 4.7.16\n(2) For paragraph (1) (c), the firm must not consider that full and timely\nrepayment is likely unless the counterparty has made regular and\ntimely payments of amounts equal to:\n(a) if any amount was past due when the forbearance was applied —\nthat amount; or\n(b) if no amount was then past due — any amount that has been\nwritten off under the forbearance measures.\n(3) In exceptional circumstances and with the Regulatory Authority’s\napproval, an Islamic banking business firm may reclassify a forborne\nnon-performing exposure as performing if repayments have been\nmade when due over a continuous period of less than 12 months, if\nall of the following conditions are satisfied:\n(a) the firm has taken remedial measures to restructure the\ncounterparty’s business;\n(b) the measures:\n(i) provide for the firm to participate directly in the\ncounterparty’s business;\n(ii) are immediately applicable; and\n(iii) make the full repayment of the exposure likely.\n(4) However, an Islamic banking business firm must not automatically\nreclassify a non-performing exposure as performing in any of the\nfollowing circumstances:\n(a) the firm has written off part of the exposure because it considers\nthat the part written off is uncollectable;\n(b) if the firm has taken possession of collateral on the exposure —\nuntil the collateral is actually disposed of and the firm has\nreceived the proceeds;\n(c) the firm applies forbearance to the exposure or extends an\nexisting application of forbearance.\nNote For forbearance, see Division 4.7.C.\npage 274 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nProblem assets and provisioning Part 4.7\nRule 4.7.16\n(5) The reclassification of a non-performing exposure as performing is to\nbe at the same level (that is, at the level of the counterparty or at the\nlevel of the transaction) as when the exposure was classified as non-\nperforming.\nGuidance — impairment and regulatory treatment of accounting provisions\n1 The Regulatory Authority expects authorised firms to adopt the following\napproach to the three provisioning stages:\n• stage 1 (representing 12-month expected credit loss (ECL) provisions\non performing financings): allocate to General Provisions (GP), if held\nagainst future, presently unidentified losses and, therefore, freely\navailable to meet losses that subsequently materialise\n• stage 2 (representing lifetime ECL provisions on underperforming\nfinancings): consider as Specific Provision for regulatory purposes.\nHowever, any portion that represents an amount for future, presently\nunidentified losses, would qualify as a GP\n• stage 3 (representing lifetime ECL provisions on non-performing\nfinancings): consider as Specific Provision for regulatory purposes.\n2 The GP amount that may be included in tier 2 capital remains unchanged at\n1.25% limit on credit risk-weighted assets.\n3 ECL accounting provisions for exposures may be treated as general provisions\nfor regulatory purposes if the firm can satisfactorily demonstrate that:\n• the provision amount is a purely forward looking amount for future,\npresently unidentified losses, set aside in consideration only of the\nconsequences of potential events or scenarios that could lead to\nidentified losses in the future; and\n• there is no evidence the provision relates to the identified deterioration\nof particular assets or covers exposures on which any impairment or\ndefault (individually or collectively) has materialised into identified\nlosses.\n4 Accounting provisions for exposures not meeting both of the abovementioned\ncriteria should be treated as specific provisions for regulatory purposes.\nGuidance — mapping of IFRS 9 expected credit losses to Regulatory\nAuthority’s regulatory classification\nECL impairment bucket Treatment in prudential returns\nStage 1: Includes exposures at initial This correlates to the performing\nrecognition, and those where there is financings category and any provisions\nno significant increase in credit risk are treated as general provisions (GP),\nsince initial recognition, or exposures held against future, presently\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 275\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule 4.7.17\nECL impairment bucket Treatment in prudential returns\nthat have low credit risk on reporting unidentified losses and, therefore,\ndate.

The\nfollowing list of indications that a counterparty is in financial difficulty is not\nintended to be exhaustive:\n• the counterparty is currently past due on a material exposure\n• no exposure to the counterparty is currently past due, but a material one is\nlikely to be past due in future (for instance, there has been a pattern of\ndelinquency in payments on its material exposures) unless a concession is\nmade\n• the counterparty’s outstanding securities have been delisted, are in the process\nof being delisted, or are under threat of being delisted, from an exchange for\nnon-compliance with the listing requirements or for financial reasons\n• on the basis of the counterparty’s actual performance, and estimates and\nprojections that take into account the counterparty’s current capabilities, the\nfirm expects that, for the foreseeable future, the counterparty’s available cash\nflows will be insufficient to service all its financings or debt securities (both\nprofit and principal) in accordance with the terms of the existing agreements\n• the counterparty has already shown that it has difficulty in repaying in\naccordance with the credit categorisation scheme within the firm’s internal\ncredit rating system\n• a material exposure to the counterparty is classified as non-performing or\nwould be so classified without the concessions\n• the counterparty cannot obtain funds from other sources at an effective profit\nrate equal to the current market profit rate for similar financings or debt\nsecurities for a non-troubled counterparty.\n(4) Refinancing an existing exposure with a new contract because of the\ncounterparty’s financial difficulty is a concession, even if the terms\nof the new contract are no more favourable to the counterparty than\nthose of the existing one.\n(5) The main characteristic of a concession is that the firm would not\nextend financings or grant commitments to the counterparty, or\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 277\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule 4.7.17\npurchase its debt securities, on such terms and conditions under\nnormal market conditions.\n(6) A concession might, but need not, result in a loss for the firm. A\nconcession could be any of the following:\n(a) a modification of the terms and conditions of the exposure;\n(b) a total or partial refinance of the exposure;\n(c) changes in the conditions of the existing exposure, giving more\nfavourable terms for the counterparty;\n(d) a supplementary agreement;\n(e) the exercise of contractual rights that enable the counterparty to\nchange the terms and conditions of the contract or to take on\nadditional financings, debt securities or off-balance-sheet items\nat its own discretion.\nExamples of concessions\n• extending the financing term\n• rescheduling the dates of principal or profit payments\n• granting new or additional periods of non-payment (grace period)\n• reducing the profit rate, resulting in an effective profit rate below the rate that\ncounterparties with similar risk characteristics could obtain in the market\n• capitalising arrears\n• forgiving, deferring or postponing principal, profit or fees\n• changing an amortising financing to a profit payment only\n• releasing collateral or accepting lower levels of collateralisation\n• allowing the conversion of debt to equity of the counterparty\n• deferring recovery or collection action for extended periods\n• easing of covenants\n• refinancing an existing exposure with a new contract, even if the terms of the\nnew contract are no more favourable for the counterparty than those of the\nexisting exposure.\npage 278 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nProblem assets and provisioning Part 4.7\nRule 4.7.18\n4.7.18 Meaning of forborne exposure and forbearance for\nPart 4.7\n(1) For this Part, an exposure of an Islamic banking business firm is a\nforborne exposure if the firm has granted a concession (see\nrule 4.7.17) to the counterparty.\nNote There is no concession to a counterparty (and therefore no forbearance)\nunless the counterparty is experiencing, or is likely to experience,\nfinancial difficulty — see rule 4.7.17 (2).\n(2) In the circumstances described in subrule (1), the firm has granted\nforbearance to the counterparty, and has applied forbearance to the\nexposure.\n4.7.19 Relationship between performance and forbearance\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may apply forbearance to either a\nperforming or a non-performing exposure.\n(2) If an Islamic banking business firm applies forbearance to a non-\nperforming exposure, the firm must continue to classify the exposure\nas non-performing.\n4.7.20 Application of forbearance to performing exposures\n(1) This rule applies if an Islamic banking business firm applies\nforbearance to a performing exposure.\n(2) The firm must decide whether the exposure meets the definition of a\nnon-performing exposure, even if the forbearance results in a new\nexposure.\n(3) If the firm decides that the original exposure would have been treated\nas non-performing when the firm applied the forbearance, the new\nexposure must be treated as non-performing.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 279\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule 4.7.21\n4.7.21 Criteria for exit from forbearance\n(1) An exposure to which forbearance has been applied continues to be a\nforborne exposure until:\n(a) all payments, according to the new contractual terms, have been\nmade in a timely manner over a continuous period of at least\n1 year; and\n(b) the counterparty has resolved its financial difficulty.\n(2) The period mentioned in subrule (1) (a) starts at the scheduled start\nof payments under the new contractual terms, regardless of whether\nthe exposure was classified as performing or non-performing when\nthe forbearance was granted.\n(3) If another forbearance is applied to a forborne exposure before its\nrelease from the first forbearance, that period starts again with the\nnew forbearance.\n(4) Nothing prevents the period mentioned in subrule (1) (a) for an\nexposure from running concurrently with a period mentioned in\nrule 4.7.16 (1) for the same exposure.\nDivision 4.7.D Provisioning\n4.7.22 Meaning of provisioning\nProvisioning means setting aside an amount to cover expected losses,\nbased on financing-loss probability. Provisioning is made before\nprofit is earned.\n4.7.23 Credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must adopt, document and adhere\nto sound methods that address policies, processes and controls for\nassessing and measuring credit losses on all the firm’s exposures. The\nmeasurement of provisions must build on robust methods and must\nresult in the appropriate and timely recognition of expected credit\nlosses in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.\npage 280 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nProblem assets and provisioning Part 4.7\nRule 4.7.24\n(2) The firm’s aggregate amount of provisions for credit losses must be\nadequate and consistent with the applicable accounting standard.\n(3) The firm must have sound policies and processes to appropriately\nvalidate the models that it uses to assess and measure expected credit\nlosses.\n(4) The firm must use experienced credit judgement, particularly in the\nrobust consideration of reasonable and supportable forward-looking\ninformation, including macroeconomic factors, in its assessment and\nmeasurement of expected credit losses.\n(5) The firm must have an appropriate credit risk assessment and\nmeasurement process that provides it with a sound basis for common\nsystems, tools and data to assess credit risk and to account for\nexpected credit losses.\n4.7.24 Provisioning policy\nDepending on the nature, scale and complexity of an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm’s business, and of the credit it provides, the firm’s\nprovisioning policy must set out:\n(a) the areas of its business to which the policy applies;\n(b) whether the firm uses different approaches to those areas, and\nthe significant differences in approach;\n(c) who is responsible for regularly monitoring its assets, to identify\nproblem or potential problem assets, and the factors it takes into\naccount in identifying them;\n(d) the extent to which the value of any collateral, guarantees or\ninsurance that the firm holds affects the need for, or the level of,\nprovisions;\n(e) the basis on which the firm makes its provisions, including the\nextent to which their levels are left to managerial judgement or\nto a committee;\n(f) the methods, debt management systems or formulae used to set\nthe levels of provisions and the factors that must be considered\nin deciding whether the provisions are adequate;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 281\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule 4.7.25\n(g) the reports to enable the firm’s governing body and senior\nmanagement to ensure that the firm maintains adequate\nprovisions;\n(h) the procedures and responsibilities for arrears management and\nthe recovery of exposures in arrears or exposures that have had\nprovisions made against them;\n(i) the procedures for writing off and writing back provisions; and\n(j) the procedures for calculating and making provisions for\ncontingent and other liabilities (such as contingent liabilities that\nhave crystallised from acceptances, endorsements, guarantees,\nperformance bonds, indemnities, irrevocable letters of credit and\nthe confirmation of documentary credits).\n4.7.25 Making provision for credit losses\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must ensure that it maintains\nprovisions for credit losses that, taken together, are prudent,\nreasonable and adequate to absorb such losses, given the relevant\nfacts and circumstances. The losses covered must include:\n(a) losses incurred;\n(b) losses incurred but not yet reported; and\n(c) losses estimated but not certain to arise;\nextending over the life of the individual credits that make up its credit\nportfolio.\n(2) The firm must also ensure that provisions and write-offs are timely\nand reflect realistic repayment and recovery expectations, taking into\naccount market and macroeconomic conditions. The firm must\nconsider all the significant factors that affect the likelihood of\ncollecting on the transactions that make up its credit portfolio and the\nestimated future credit losses on those transactions.\n(3) Provisions may be general (assessed collectively against the whole of\na portfolio) or specific (assessed against individual credits), or both.\npage 282 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nProblem assets and provisioning Part 4.7\nRule 4.7.26\n(4) The firm must take into account off-balance-sheet exposures in\nprovisioning. However, no provisioning is necessary for off-balance-\nsheet exposures that the firm can unilaterally cancel.\n4.7.26 Amount of provisioning\n(1) Subject to any direction under subrule (2), an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm must make provision for credit losses in accordance\nwith the applicable accounting standard.\n(2) If the Regulatory Authority considers that the firm’s provisioning for\nan exposure, or some or all of its exposures, is insufficient, the\nAuthority may direct the firm to apply rule 4.7.27.\n4.7.27 Prescribed provisioning\n(1) If the Regulatory Authority considers that an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm’s own practices for identifying provisions are\ninadequate in view of its credit risk profile, the Authority may direct\nthe firm to implement prescribed provisioning in accordance with this\nrule.\n(2) To implement prescribed provisioning, the firm must classify\nexposures to which this Part applies (subject to subrule (7)) into the 5\ncategories in subrule (3).\n(3) The classification is as follows:\n(a) an exposure is classified as performing if:\n(i) there is no uncertainty about the timely repayment of the\noutstanding amounts; and\n(ii) it is currently in regular payment status with prompt\npayments;\n(b) an exposure is classified as special mention if any of the\nfollowing subparagraphs is true of it:\n(i) it is of deteriorating or potentially deteriorating credit\nquality that may adversely affect the counterparty’s ability\nto make scheduled payments on time;\n(ii) it is 30 to 90 days in arrears;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 283\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.7 Problem assets and provisioning\nRule .27\n(iii) it shows weakness arising from the counterparty’s\nfinancial position;\n(iv) it is affected by market circumstances or any other\nindustry-related concerns;\n(c) an exposure is classified as substandard if:\n(i) it shows definite deterioration in credit quality and\nimpaired repayment ability of the counterparty; or\n(ii) it is 91 to 180 days in arrears;\n(d) an exposure is classified as doubtful if:\n(i) it shows significant credit quality deterioration, worse than\nin the substandard category, to the extent that the prospect\nof fully recovering all the outstanding amounts is\nquestionable and the probability of a loss is high (though\nthe exact amount of loss cannot be determined yet); or\n(ii) it is 181 to 270 days in arrears;\n(e) an exposure is classified as loss if:\n(i) it is assessed as uncollectable;\n(ii) the probability of recovering the amount due is very low;\nor\n(iii) it is more than 270 days in arrears.\n(4) Nothing prevents the firm from classifying an exposure in a higher\ncategory than subrule (3) requires. For this subrule, the highest\ncategory is loss, and the lowest is performing.\n(5) The firm must classify all of its exposures to a particular counterparty\nas of the same category unless there is good reason not to do so.\n(6) The firm must make provisions for credit losses that in total at least\nmeet the requirements in table 4.7.27.\nNote If the result is to increase the firm’s provision for credit losses, the amount\nof the increase must be deducted from CET 1 capital — see rule 3.2.30.\npage 284 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nProblem assets and provisioning Part 4.7\nRule 4.7.10\n(7) Prescribed provisioning does not apply to exposures of the following\nkinds:\n(a) forborne exposures (see Division 4.7.C) that meet the criteria to\nbe classified as performing (see rule 4.7.10);\n(b) any asset acquired through enforcing a security;\n(c) real estate that the firm owns.\nTable 4.7.27 Provisioning requirements\nCategory of minimum provisioning\nexposure requirement\n(% of unsecured part of credit)\nPerforming 0\nSpecial mention 5 (or a lesser percentage\ndirected by the Authority)\nSubstandard 20\nDoubtful 50\nLoss 100\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 285\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.8 Transactions with related parties\nRule 4.8.1\nPart 4.8 Transactions with related parties\n4.8.1 Introduction\n(1) To guard against abuses in lending to related parties and to address\nconflicts of interest, this Part requires transactions with related parties\nto be at arm’s length and subject to appropriate supervision and limits.\n(2) Related-party transactions must be interpreted broadly. Related party\ntransactions include on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet credit\nexposures, service contracts, asset purchases and sales, construction\ncontracts, lease agreements, borrowing and write-offs.\n4.8.2 Concept of related parties\n(1) The concept of parties being related to an Islamic banking business\nfirm is used in these rules in relation to parties over which the firm\nexercises control or parties that exercise control over the firm. The\nconcept is primarily used in relation to the requirement that the firm’s\ntransactions be at arm’s length.\n(2) In contrast, the concept of parties being connected to one another\n(which is discussed with concentration risk in Chapter 5) is used in\nthese rules to measure concentration risk and large exposures.\n(3) It is of course possible for connected counterparties to be related to\nthe banking business firm holding the exposure concerned.\nNote For purposes of concentration risk, the firm’s exposure to connected\ncounterparties (whether related or not) is taken to be a single risk.\n4.8.3 Related parties\nRelated parties, of an Islamic banking business firm, includes:\n(a) any other member of the firm’s corporate group;\n(b) any individual who is able to exercise significant influence over\nthe firm;\n(c) any affiliate of the firm; and\npage 286 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nTransactions with related parties Part 4.8\nRule 4.8.4\n(d) any entity that the Regulatory Authority directs the firm to\ninclude.\nGuidance\nRelated party is wider than a firm’s corporate group in that it includes individuals.\nRelated parties include the banking business firm’s subsidiaries and major stock\nholders; members of its governing body; its senior management and key employees.\nNote Affiliate is defined in the glossary.\n4.8.4 Role of governing body—related parties\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s governing body must ensure that\nthe firm’s policies relating to related-party transactions are complied\nwith and that any exceptions are reported to the appropriate level of\nthe senior management, and, if necessary, to the governing body.\n(2) The governing body must also ensure that the firm’s senior\nmanagement monitors transactions with related parties, takes\nappropriate steps to control or mitigate the risks from such\ntransactions and writes off exposures to related parties only in\naccordance with the firm’s policies.\n(3) The governing body must approve transactions with related parties,\nand the write-off of related-party exposures, if such transactions or\nwrite-off exceeds specified amounts or otherwise poses any special\nrisk.\n4.8.5 Policies—transactions with related parties\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s policy must establish:\n(a) effective systems to identify, monitor and report individual and\ntotal exposures to, and transactions with, related parties;\n(b) procedures to prevent a member of the governing body, a\nmember of the firm’s senior management or any other person\nwho stands to gain a benefit from a related-party transaction\nfrom being part of the process of granting and managing the\ntransaction;\n(c) well-defined criteria for writing-off exposures to related parties;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 287\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 4 Credit risk\nPart 4.8 Transactions with related parties\nRule 4.8.6\n(d) prudent and appropriate limits to prevent or address conflicts of\ninterest; and\n(e) procedures for tracking and reporting exceptions to, and\ndeviations from, limits or policies.\n4.8.6 Transactions must be arm’s length\nA transaction with a related party must not be undertaken on terms\nmore favourable to the party than a corresponding transaction with a\nnon-related party.\nGuidance\nFavourable terms could relate to credit assessment, tenor, fees, amortisation\nschedule and need for collateral. An exception for beneficial terms could be\nappropriate if it is part of an employee’s remuneration package.\n4.8.7 Limits on lending to related parties\nAn Islamic banking business firm must not enter into a transaction\nthat would cause it to exceed the limits set out in table 4.8.7 unless it\nhas the written approval of the Regulatory Authority to do so.\nTable 4.8.7 Limits on banking business firms’ exposure to related parties\ncolumn 1 column 2 column 3\nitem kind of exposure limit (% of total\nassets)\n1 exposures to a member of the governing body 0.5\nor senior management of the firm, or a person\nconnected to either of them\n2 the total of exposures under item 1 3\n3 exposures to a significant shareholder of the 2\nfirm (other than exposures to a shareholder\nthat is an Islamic banking business firm or an\nequivalent entity regulated in a way\ncomparable to an Islamic banking business\nfirm in the QFC)\npage 288 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nCredit risk Chapter 4\nTransactions with related parties Part 4.8\nRule 4.8.8\ncolumn 1 column 2 column 3\nitem kind of exposure limit (% of total\nassets)\n4 the total of exposures under item 3 5\n5 exposures to a related party or a party 2\nconnected to the related party (other than\nexposures to an Islamic banking business firm\nor an equivalent entity regulated in a way\ncomparable to an Islamic banking business\nfirm in the QFC)\n6 the total of exposures under item 5 5\n4.8.8 Powers of Regulatory Authority\n(1) Despite anything in these rules, the Regulatory Authority may, in\nwriting, set specific limits on an Islamic banking business firm’s\nexposures to a related party or to related parties in total.\n(2) The authority may direct such exposures to be deducted from\nregulatory capital when assessing capital adequacy or direct that such\nexposures be collateralised.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 289\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.1 General\nRule 5.1.1\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large\nexposures\nPart 5.1 General\n5.1.1 Introduction\n(1) This Chapter sets out the requirements for an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm’s policies to identify, measure, evaluate, manage and\ncontrol or mitigate concentration risk. This Chapter also sets limits on\nthe firm’s exposures to individual counterparties and connected\ncounterparties.\n(2) Concentration risk is the potential for a loss in value of an investment\nportfolio or a financial institution when a group of exposures moves\ntogether in an unfavourable direction. Concentration risk in an\nIslamic banking business firm’s portfolio arises from concentration\non a single counterparty, sector or country.\nGuidance\nThe implication of concentration risk is that it generates such a significant loss that\nrecovery is unlikely.\n5.1.2 Meaning of risk concentration\n(1) A risk concentration is a single exposure, or a group of exposures\nwith a common element, that is capable of producing a loss that is\nlarge enough:\n(a) to threaten an Islamic banking business firm’s viability or its\nability to maintain its core operations; or\n(b) to produce a material change in its risk profile.\n(2) A risk concentration can arise in an Islamic banking business firm’s\nassets, liabilities or off-balance-sheet items through the execution or\npage 290 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nGeneral Part 5.1\nRule 5.1.3\nprocessing of transactions (either product or service), or through a\ncombination of exposures.\nGuidance\nExamples of a common element among an Islamic banking business firm’s\nexposures that could create a risk concentration are the following:\n• that the counterparties are connected or related\n• that the exposures are disproportionately denominated in a particular currency\n• that the counterparties are concentrated in particular geographical locations or\nparticular industry sectors\n• that the exposures are concentrated in particular products\n• reliance on particular service providers (such as a provider of back-office\nservices).\n5.1.3 Identification of risk concentrations\nAn Islamic banking business firm must identify the risk\nconcentrations in its portfolio, including those arising from:\n(a) large exposures to a single counterparty;\n(b) exposures to connected counterparties;\n(c) exposures to counterparties in the same industry, economic\nsector, geographical region or country; and\n(d) exposures to counterparties whose financial performance\ndepends on the same activity, commodity or product.\n5.1.4 Policies — risk concentrations — sources and limits\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must have a policy on the\nmanagement of risk concentrations.\n(2) The policy must set limits for acceptable risk concentrations,\nconsistent with the firm’s risk appetite, risk profile and capital. The\nlimits must be made known to, and must be understood by, all\nrelevant staff.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 291\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.1 General\nRule 5.1.5\n(3) The policy must ensure that:\n(a) the firm’s information systems identify exposures that create\nrisk concentrations, aggregate those exposures and facilitate\ntheir management; and\n(b) all significant risk concentrations are reviewed regularly and\nreported to the firm’s governing body or senior management.\nGuidance\nAn Islamic banking business firm’s policies should be flexible to help the firm to\nidentify risk concentrations. To achieve this, the systems should be capable of\nanalysing the firm’s credit portfolio by:\n• size of exposure\n• exposures to connected counterparties\n• product\n• geography\n• industry or sector (for example, manufacturing and industrial)\n• account performance\n• internal credit risk assessment\n• funding\n• outstandings versus commitments\n• types and coverage of collateral.\n5.1.5 Role of governing body — risk concentrations\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s governing body must ensure that\nthe firm’s policy for the management of risk concentrations gives a\ncomprehensive firm-wide view of the significant sources of risk\nconcentrations (including exposures on and off its balance sheet and\nfrom contingent liabilities).\n(2) The governing body must also ensure that the firm’s senior\nmanagement monitors the firm’s large exposures, and that the large\nexposure limits (see rule 5.2.9) are not exceeded on a solo or\nconsolidated basis.\npage 292 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nGeneral Part 5.1\nRule 5.1.6\n5.1.6 Relationship to stress-testing\nWhen carrying out stress-testing or reviewing stress scenarios, an\nIslamic banking business firm must take into account significant risk\nconcentrations and large exposures, and the effects of changes in\nmarket conditions and risk factors on them.\n5.1.7 Regulatory Authority can set different limits and\nminimum capital adequacy ratios\n(1) Despite anything in these rules, the Regulatory Authority may, in\nwriting, set specific limits on an Islamic banking business firm’s\nexposures to particular counterparties, groups of counterparties,\nindustries, sectors, regions, countries or asset classes on a case-by-\ncase basis.\n(2) If an Islamic banking business firm has 1 or more large exposures\n(excluding exempted exposures) or if, in the Authority’s opinion, the\nfirm is exposed to a significant level of risk concentration, the\nAuthority may increase any 1 or more of the firm’s minimum capital\nadequacy ratios.\n(3) In considering whether to increase any of the firm’s minimum capital\nadequacy ratios, the Authority will take into account:\n(a) whether the increased ratio would be consistent with the firm’s\nrisk concentration and large exposure policies;\n(b) the number of exposures, and the size and nature of each; and\n(c) the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s business and the\nexperience of its governing body and senior management.\n(4) The Regulatory Authority may also direct the firm to take measures\nto reduce its level of risk concentration.\nNote Under FSR, article 16, the Regulatory Authority may modify or waive\nthe application of a prudential requirement to an authorised firm or firms.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 293\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.1\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nDivision 5.2.A General\n5.2.1 What Part 5.2 does\nThis Part implements, for Islamic banking business firms in the QFC,\nthe recommendations of the BCBS and IFRS about the management\nof large exposures.\n5.2.2 Definitions for Part 5.2\nIn this Part:\nexempted counterparty means a counterparty that is any of the\nfollowing:\n(a) a sovereign;\n(b) a central bank;\n(c) a PSE that is assigned a 0% risk weight under rule 4.4.14;\n(d) an MDB that qualifies for 0% risk weight.\nNote For the list of such MDBs, see rule 4.4.16.\nexempted exposure means an exposure that arises from a claim,\ncommitment or contingent liability of any of the following kinds:\n(a) a claim by, or a commitment or contingent liability to, an\nexempted counterparty;\n(b) a claim, commitment or contingent liability the amount of which\nis deducted from the firm’s regulatory capital (see\nDivision 3.2.D);\nGuidance\nIf the amount of such a claim, commitment or contingent liability were not\ndeducted from the firm’s regulatory capital, it would be added to the firm’s\nother exposures to the relevant counterparty.

In\nparticular, the policies must include:\n(a) exposure limits, commensurate with the firm’s risk appetite, risk\nprofile and capital, for exposures to:\n(i) categories of counterparties (for example, sovereigns,\nother authorised firms and other financial entities,\ncorporate and individual borrowers);\n(ii) single counterparties and groups of connected\ncounterparties;\n(iii) particular industries or sectors;\n(iv) particular countries; and\n(v) asset classes (for example, property holdings);\n(b) the circumstances in which the exposure limits may be\nexceeded, and the processes required for approving such\nexcesses (for example, approval by the firm’s governing body);\nand\n(c) procedures for identifying, measuring, managing and reporting\nlarge exposures.\n(2) The policies must ensure that the firm:\n(a) has adequate systems and controls to identify, measure, monitor\nand report large exposures and risk concentrations in a timely\nmanner; and\n(b) reviews its large exposures and risk concentrations at least\nannually.\npage 296 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.5\nDivision 5.2.B Connected counterparties\n5.2.5 Meaning of group of connected counterparties\nTwo or more of an Islamic banking business firm’s counterparties\n(other than exempted counterparties) form a group of connected\ncounterparties if:\n(a) they are connected by any 1 or more of the following:\n(i) a control relationship (see rule 5.2.6);\n(ii) a relationship of economic interdependence (see\nrule 5.2.7);\n(iii) any other connection or relationship that, in the firm’s\nopinion, requires it to treat the counterparties as\nconstituting a single risk;\n(b) in the case of investments in structured vehicles — they have in\ncommon a third party (such as an originator, fund manager,\nliquidity provider or credit protection provider) that should be\ntreated as a common risk factor (see rule 5.2.23).\nGuidance\n1 The concept of parties or counterparties being connected to one another is used\nin these rules in relation to counterparties or issuers to which an Islamic\nbanking business firm has exposures. Connected counterparties are the basis\nfor measuring risk concentrations and large exposures.\n2 Nothing prevents the members of a group of connected counterparties being\nconnected in 2 or more of the ways mentioned. If counterparties that are part\nof different control groups are interconnected by economic interdependency,\nall entities for which there is a “chain of contagion” need to be grouped into\none group of connected counterparties. The chain of contagion leading to a\npossible default of all entities concerned is the relevant factor for the grouping\nand needs to be assessed in each individual case.\n3 In contrast, the concept of parties being related to an Islamic banking business\nfirm (which is discussed with credit risk in Chapter 4) is primarily used in\nrelation to the requirement that the firm’s transactions be at arm’s length.\n4 It is of course possible for a firm’s related parties to be connected\ncounterparties (such as when the firm has exposures to them).\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 297\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.6\n5.2.6 Connected counterparties — control relationship\n(1) A control relationship exists between 2 counterparties if either has\ncontrol of the other.\n(2) Whether a control relationship exists between 2 counterparties is to\nbe decided in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.\nGuidance\n1 A control relationship is likely to exist between 2 counterparties if 1 of them\nowns 50% or more of the voting rights in the other.\n2 To decide whether a control relationship exists between 2 counterparties, an\nIslamic banking business firm should take at least the following factors into\naccount:\n• the existence of voting agreements (such as control of a majority of\nvoting rights by means of an agreement with other shareholders)\n• whether a member (A) is able to exercise significant influence over the\nappointment or dismissal of another member’s administrative,\nmanagement or supervisory body (for example, if A has as the right to\nappoint or remove a majority of members of such a body, or a majority\nof members of such a body have been appointed solely as a result of A’s\nexercise of its voting rights)\n• whether a member (A) is able to exercise significant influence over the\nsenior management of another (B) (for example, A has the power to\nexercise a controlling influence over B’s management or policies (such\nas by A’s having consent rights over significant decisions)).\n(3) However, even if control of 1 entity by another is established, the\nIslamic banking business firm concerned need not treat the\ncounterparties as a group of connected counterparties if it can show\nthe Regulatory Authority that, despite the control, the entities do not\nform a group of connected counterparties (for example, because of\nparticular circumstances or corporate governance safeguards).\n5.2.7 Connected counterparties — economic interdependence\n(1) To decide whether or not 2 counterparties are connected by a\nrelationship of economic interdependence, an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm must take into account at least the following matters:\n(a) whether 50% or more of 1 counterparty’s gross receipts or gross\nexpenditures (on an annual basis) is derived from transactions\npage 298 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.7\nwith the other (for example, the owner of a property and a tenant\nthat pays a significant part of the rent);\n(b) whether 1 counterparty has fully or partly guaranteed the\nexposure of the other, or is liable by other means, and the\nrelevant exposure is so significant that the guarantor would be\nlikely to default if a claim were made;\n(c) whether a significant part of 1 counterparty’s production or\noutput is sold to the other, and the other could not easily be\nreplaced by other customers within a reasonable period;\n(d) whether the expected source of funds to repay the financings of\nboth counterparties is the same and neither has another\nindependent source of income from which financings could be\nserviced and fully repaid;\n(e) whether it is likely that 1 counterparty’s financial problems\nwould cause difficulties for the other in terms of full and timely\nrepayment of the other’s liabilities;\n(f) whether 1 counterparty’s insolvency or default would be likely\nto be associated with the insolvency or default of the other;\n(g) if both counterparties rely on the same provider for the majority\nof their funding — whether, if funding from the common\nprovider were to become unavailable, an alternative provider\ncould not be found.\n(2) However, even if economic interdependence between\n2 counterparties is established based on subrule (1), the firm need not\ntreat them as a group of connected counterparties if the firm can show\nthe Regulatory Authority that despite the interdependence, either\ncounterparty could overcome financial difficulties, or even the other\ncounterparty’s default, by finding other customers or funding sources\nwithin a reasonable period.\nGuidance\nIf the sum of all of an Islamic banking business firm’s exposures to a particular\ncounterparty is more than 5% of the firm’s tier 1 capital, the firm should investigate\nthe relationships between all of its counterparties (other than exempted\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page

of\nconnected counterparties because of a relationship of economic interdependence.\nFor the meaning of tier 1 capital, see rule 3.2.7 (2).\n5.2.8 Regulatory Authority can create relationships\nIf the Regulatory Authority considers it necessary or desirable to do\nso in the interests of the effective supervision of an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm, the Authority may direct the firm to treat a counterparty\nas connected to another counterparty.\nDivision 5.2.C Management of large exposures\n5.2.9 Limits on large exposures\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s exposure to any 1 counterparty\n(except an exempted counterparty), or any 1 group of connected\ncounterparties, must not be greater than 25% of the firm’s tier 1\ncapital.\nNote For the meaning of tier 1 capital, see rule 3.2.7 (2).\n(2) The total of all of the firm’s net large exposures must not exceed\n800% of the firm’s tier 1 capital.\nNote The amount of any breach of a large exposure limit must be deducted\nfrom CET 1 capital — see rule 3.2.41.\n5.2.10 Exposures that would breach limit — approval by\nRegulatory Authority\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may apply to the Regulatory\nAuthority for the approval of an exposure that is greater than a large\nexposure limit.\n(2) The Authority will grant the approval only in exceptional\ncircumstances and only after the firm satisfies the Authority that the\nproposed exposure does not expose the firm to excessive risk.\n(3) If the Authority approves the exposure, the Authority may increase\nany 1 or more of the firm’s minimum capital adequacy ratios to\ncompensate for the additional risk associated with the exposure.\nNote 1 For the meaning of minimum capital adequacy ratios, see rule 3.2.6.\npage 300 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.11\nNote 2 The firm must deduct, from CET 1 capital, the amount by which the limit\nwas exceeded, unless the Authority has approved the excess — see\nrule 3.2.41.\n5.2.11 Breaches of limits — reporting and rectification\nIf an Islamic banking business firm breaches a large exposure limit:\n(a) it must immediately report the matter to the Regulatory\nAuthority; and\n(b) it must take immediate action to rectify the breach.\n5.2.12 Periodic reporting of large exposures etc\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must report the following to the\nRegulatory Authority:\n(a) each of the firm’s exposures (other than exempted exposures) to\nany 1 counterparty, or any 1 group of connected counterparties,\nthat is equal to 10% or more of the firm’s tier 1 capital;\n(b) each of the firm’s exposures (other than exempted exposures) to\nany 1 counterparty, or any 1 group of connected counterparties,\nthat is equal to 10% or more of the firm’s tier 1 capital if the\neffect of credit risk mitigation is not taken into account;\n(c) every exempted exposure that is equal to 10% or more of the\nfirm’s tier 1 capital;\nGuidance\nThe exposures that must be reported under paragraph (c) include exposures\nto exempted counterparties.\n(d) the firm’s largest 20 exposures (other than exempted exposures)\nto a single counterparty or a single group of connected\ncounterparties, regardless of the values of those exposures\nrelative to the firm’s tier 1 capital.\n(2) The reporting period for subrule (1) is to be as agreed with, or directed\nby, the Authority.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015

claims, commitments and contingent liabilities\nmust be taken into account\n(1) When an Islamic banking business firm calculates its exposure to a\ncounterparty or group of connected counterparties, the firm must take\ninto account every claim, commitment or contingent liability (other\nthan a claim, commitment or contingent liability that is, or gives rise\nto, an exempted exposure) that it would be required to take into\naccount when calculating its risk-based capital requirement.\nNote For how to calculate the firm’s risk-based capital requirement, see\nrule 3.2.5.\n(2) The firm must take into account every such claim, commitment or\nliability on or off the firm’s balance sheet, and whether in the firm’s\nbanking book or its trading book.\n5.2.14 Calculating exposure — general rules\n(1) This rule sets out how to calculate, for this Part, an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm’s exposure arising from a claim, commitment or\ncontingent liability.\n(2) In general, except in the cases mentioned in subrules (3) to (5), the\namount of the exposure is the accounting value (net of specific\nprovisions and value adjustments) of the claim, commitment or\nliability.\n(3) If the exposure arises from an instrument that gives rise to\ncounterparty credit risk and is not an SFT, the firm’s exposure is the\nexposure at default for the instrument (see Part 4.6A).\n(4) If the exposure arises from an SFT, the firm’s exposure is the amount\ncalculated in accordance with the comprehensive approach in\nSubdivision 4.6.B.3.\n(5) If the exposure arises from an off-balance-sheet item, the firm’s\nexposure is the item’s credit equivalent amount, calculated in\npage 302 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.15\naccordance with Division 4.4.C. In calculating the item’s credit\nequivalent amount, however, a minimum CCF of 10% must be used.\n5.2.15 Eligible CRM techniques\n(1) For this Part, when an Islamic banking business firm is calculating\nthe amount of its exposure from a claim, commitment or contingent\nliability:\n(a) it must apply any CRM technique that applies to the claim,\ncommitment or liability, and that the firm would apply when\ncalculating its risk-weighted capital requirement; but\n(b) it must not take into account any other CRM technique.\nNote Under Part 4.6, the firm may apply any of the following CRM techniques:\n• eligible collateral (see Division 4.6.B) in either the simple or the\ncomprehensive approach\n• an eligible guarantee (see Division 4.6.C)\n• an eligible SCHI (see Division 4.6.D).\n(2) The firm must reduce the value of the exposure to the original\ncounterparty by the recognised amount (that is, the amount by which\nthe technique reduced the exposure for risk-based capital\nrequirements purposes).\nGuidance\nThe recognised amount is:\n• for unfunded credit protection — the value of the protected portion\n• for eligible collateral, if the firm uses the simple approach (see\nSubdivision 4.6.B.2) to calculate its risk-based capital requirement — the\nvalue of the part of the claim that is collateralised by the market value of the\ncollateral\n• for eligible collateral, if the firm uses the comprehensive approach (see\nSubdivision 4.6.B.3) to calculate its risk-based capital requirement — the\nvalue of the adjusted collateral after applying the haircuts required under the\ncomprehensive approach\n• for an instrument that gives rise to counterparty credit risk (such as an OTC\nSCHI) —the value of the collateral (see Part 4.6A).\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 303\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.16\n5.2.16 Exposure to CRM providers\nIf under this Part an Islamic banking business firm must recognise the\nreduction of an exposure by a CRM technique, it must also recognise\nan exposure to the CRM provider. The amount of the exposure to the\nCRM provider is the amount by which the exposure to the original\ncounterparty or group is reduced.\n5.2.17 Claims etc hedged subject to maturity mismatch\n(1) For this Part, if a claim, commitment or contingent liability is hedged\nbut the hedge is subject to a maturity mismatch, the hedge is to be\ntaken into account only if:\n(a) the original maturities of both the claim, commitment or\ncontingent liability and the hedge are 1 year or longer; and\n(b) the residual maturity of the hedge is at least 3 months.\n(2) If an Islamic banking business firm has a maturity mismatch in\nrelation to a CRM technique that the firm can apply in calculating its\nrisk-based capital requirement, then, for the purposes of this Part, the\nfirm must adjust the credit protection provided by the technique in the\nsame way as it would when calculating its risk-based capital\nrequirement.\n5.2.18 Effect of netting\nIf an Islamic banking business firm has legally enforceable netting\narrangements for financings and deposits, the firm may calculate the\nrelevant exposure values for the purposes of this Part in the same way\nas it would to calculate its risk-based capital requirement — that is,\non the basis of the net credit exposures, subject to the conditions in\nDivision 4.6.E for netting on the balance sheet.\npage 304 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.19\n5.2.19 Investments in collective investment undertakings etc —\nwhether look-through required\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm has invested in a structure through\nan entity that itself has exposures to assets, the firm must look through\nthe structure to identify the underlyings unless:\n(a) the firm can show that the amount of its exposure to each\nunderlying is less than 0.25% of its tier 1 capital; or\n(b) the firm’s whole investment in the structure is less than 0.25%\nof its tier 1 capital.\nGuidance\nSuch structures include funds, securitisations and other structures with underlying\nassets.\nNote For the meaning of tier 1 capital, see rule 3.2.7 (2).\n(2) The firm must be able to show that a decision not to look through the\nstructure was not influenced by considerations of regulatory arbitrage\n(for example, it must be able to show that it did not circumvent a large\nexposure limit by investing in several smaller transactions that have\nidentical underlying assets).\n5.2.20 Investments in collective investment undertakings etc —\ncounterparty\n(1) This rule sets out how an Islamic banking business firm must assign\nan underlying to its investment in a structure.\n(2) For this rule:\n(a) the firm must consider only exposures to underlyings that result\nfrom its investment in the structure itself; and\n(b) the value of an exposure is to be calculated as set out in\nrule 5.2.22.\n(3) If, under rule 5.2.19, the firm is not required to look through the\nstructure to identify the underlyings, the firm must treat the structure\nitself as its counterparty.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 305\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.20\n(4) If, under rule 5.2.19, the firm is required to look through the structure\nto identify the underlyings:\n(a) for any underlying for which the exposure value is equal to\n0.25% or more of the firm’s tier 1 capital, and the counterparty\nis identifiable, the firm must treat that counterparty as its\ncounterparty;\n(b) for any underlying for which the exposure value is less than\n0.25% of the firm’s tier 1 capital, the firm may treat the structure\nitself as its counterparty;\n(c) for any underlying for which the firm cannot identify the\ncounterparty, it must assign that total amount to “the unknown\nclient”; and\n(d) for any underlying for which the firm cannot calculate the\nexposure amount, the firm must assign the nominal amount of\nits exposure to “the unknown client”.\n(5) The firm’s exposure to a counterparty under this rule must be added\nto any other direct or indirect exposure to that counterparty.\n(6) Exposures that have been assigned to “the unknown client” must be\naggregated as if “the unknown client” were a single counterparty. The\nlarge exposure limits apply to exposures to “the unknown client”.\nGuidance\nThe following flow chart summarises the effect of rule 5.2.20:\npage 306 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.21\n5.2.21 Investments in collective investment undertakings etc —\nlook-through not required — value\n(1) This rule applies to an Islamic banking business firm’s investment in\na structure if, under rule 5.2.19, the firm is not required to look\nthrough the structure to identify the underlying assets.\n(2) The firm’s exposure to the structure is taken to be the nominal amount\nthat it has invested in the structure.\n5.2.22 Investments in collective investment undertakings etc —\nlook-through required — value\n(1) This rule applies to an Islamic banking business firm’s investment in\na structure if, under rule 5.2.19, the firm is required to look through\nthe structure to identify the underlying assets.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 307\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.23\n(2) The exposure value assigned to a counterparty is equal to the pro rata\nshare that the firm holds in the structure multiplied by the value of the\nunderlying asset.\nGuidance\nThus, if the firm holds a 1% share of a structure that invests in 20 assets each with\na value of 5, it must assign an exposure of 0.05 to each of the counterparties. An\nexposure to a counterparty must be added to any other direct or indirect exposures\nthe bank has to that counterparty.\n(3) In the case of a tranched structure, the firm must measure its exposure\nvalue to a counterparty for each tranche within the structure,\nassuming a pro rata distribution of losses amongst investors in the\ntranche. To compute the exposure value to the underlying, the firm:\n(a) must first find the lower of:\n(i) the value of the tranche in which the bank invests; and\n(ii) the nominal value of each underlying in the portfolio; and\n(b) must then apply the pro rata share of the firm’s investment in the\ntranche to the value determined in the first step.\n5.2.23 Additional risk factors — role of third parties\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must identify any risk inherent in a\nstructure in relation to an exposure (such as having an originator, fund\nmanager, liquidity provider or credit protection provider) in common.\nThe firm must consider:\n(a) whether the connection by way of that entity should be treated\nas an additional risk factor; and\n(b) whether the relevant exposures should be treated as exposures\nto a group of connected counterparties.\nGuidance\nIn some cases, the manager would be regarded as a distinct counterparty so that the\nsum of a firm’s investments in all of the funds managed by that manager would be\nsubject to the large exposure limits. But in other cases, the commonality of the\nmanager might not be an additional risk factor — for example, the legal framework\nthat governs the fund might separate the legal entity that manages the fund and the\nlegal entity that has custody of its assets. In the case of a structured finance product,\npage 308 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.24\nthe liquidity provider or sponsor of a short-term programme (such as an asset-\nbacked commercial paper conduit or a structured investment vehicle) may need to\nbe considered as an additional risk factor. Similarly, in synthetic financial\ninstruments, a protection provider may be an additional source of risk and a\ncommon factor for connecting different structures.\n(2) The firm must also consider whether an entity referred to in\nsubrule (1) is connected closely enough to a counterparty of the firm\nthat the entity and the counterparty should be treated as a group of\nconnected counterparties.\nGuidance\n1 If the firm has investments in a set of structures associated with a third party\nthat constitutes a common risk factor, the firm might have to consider adding\nthe investments to other exposures (such as a financing) to that party. Whether\nit is necessary to do so depends on a case-by-case consideration of the specific\nfeatures of the structure and on the role of the third party.\n2 In the example of the fund manager, adding together the exposures may not be\nnecessary because fraudulent behaviour by the fund manager would not\nnecessarily affect the repayment of a financing. The assessment may be\ndifferent where the risk to the value of investments underlying the structures\narises in the event of a third-party default. For example, in the case of a credit\nprotection provider, the source of the additional risk for the firm’s investing in\na structure is the default of the credit protection provider. The firm should add\nthe investment in the structure to the direct exposures to the credit protection\nprovider since both exposures might crystallise into losses in the event that the\nprotection provider defaults (ignoring the covered part of the exposures may\nlead to the undesirable situation of a high risk concentration exposure to\nissuers of collateral or providers of credit protection).\n(3) If the firm considers 2 or more third parties to be potential sources of\nadditional risk, the firm must assign the exposure resulting from the\ninvestment in each relevant structure to each of the third parties.\n5.2.24 Exposure value of covered sukuk\n(1) In this rule:\ncovered sukuk has the same meaning as in rule 4.4.73 (1).\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 309\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 4.4.55\nqualifying covered sukuk means a covered sukuk that meets the\nfollowing requirements:\n(a) the underlying assets (the cover pool) include only assets of the\nfollowing kinds:\n(i) claims on, or guaranteed by, sovereigns, central banks,\nPSEs or MDBs;\n(ii) claims secured by residential real estate in relation to\nwhich the prudential requirements in rule 4.4.55 have been\ncomplied with, and with an FTV ratio of 80% or lower;\n(iii) claims secured by commercial real estate in relation to\nwhich those prudential requirements have been complied\nwith, and with an FTV ratio of 60% or lower;\n(iv) additional collateral of the following kinds:\n(A) substitution assets (that is, cash or short-term liquid\nand secure assets held in substitution for the primary\nassets to top up the cover pool for management\npurposes);\n(B) SCHIs entered into to hedge the risks arising in the\ncovered sukuk programme;\n(b) the total nominal value of the cover pool is at least 10% more\nthan the total nominal value of outstanding sukuk issued (but see\nsubrule (2));\n(c) the sukuk met the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) when\nthey were issued and will continue to do so until their maturity;\n(d) for any real estate that is part of the assets in the cover pool, the\nfollowing requirements are satisfied:\n(i) the real estate is valued at no more than the current fair\nvalue under which it could be sold under private contract\nbetween a willing seller and an arm’s-length buyer on the\ndate of valuation;\npage 310 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.25\n(ii) the firm assesses the value of the real estate frequently (at\nleast annually), or more frequently if the market is subject\nto significant changes in conditions.\n(2) For paragraph (b) of the definition of qualifying covered sukuk, an\nissue is taken to meet the requirement as to the value of the cover pool\nif:\n(a) the legislation that governs the sukuk requires the value of the\ncover pool to meet that requirement; or\n(b) if that legislation contains no such requirement — the issuer\nregularly states publicly that the value of the cover pool meets\nthat requirement.\n(3) An Islamic banking business firm may assign, to a holding of\nqualifying covered sukuk, an exposure value equal to 20% of the\nnominal value of the holding.\n(4) An Islamic banking business firm must assign, to a holding of\ncovered sukuk that are not qualifying covered sukuk, an exposure\nvalue equal to 100% of the nominal value of the holding.\n(5) The counterparty to the exposure is the issuer of the sukuk.\n5.2.25 Exposures to central counterparties that are not QCCPs\n(1) This rule relates to an Islamic banking business firm’s exposures to\ncentral counterparties that are not QCCPs.\nNote 1 Exposures to QCCPs that are related to clearing are exempted\nexposures — see rule 5.2.2, definition of exempted exposures,\nparagraph (e).\nNote 2 For the meaning of QCCP, see the Glossary.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm must measure its exposure to such\na central counterparty as the sum of the firm’s clearing exposures and\nnon-clearing exposures to the central counterparty.\n(3) For the purpose of deciding whether a QCCP is part of a group of\nconnected counterparties, exposures that are related only to clearing\nactivities are to be disregarded. However, non-clearing exposures are\nto be taken into account for that purpose.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 311\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 25\n(4) An Islamic banking business firm must identify its exposures to a\nQCCP that are related to clearing activities and must add those\nexposures together.

Therefore, positions in financial\ninstruments such as sukuk and equities are subject to the large\nexposure limits, but positions in a particular commodity or currency\nare not.\n(2) The exposure value of a sukuk or equity instrument is the market\nvalue of the instrument.\n(3) Instruments such as SCHIs held in the trading book must be converted\ninto positions in the same way as when calculating the firm’s risk-\nbased capital requirement. Such instruments must be decomposed\ninto their individual legs, and a leg is to be disregarded if it represents\nan exposure that need not, under rule 5.2.13, be taken into account for\nthis Part.\nGuidance\nA stock futures contract on stock X, for example, is decomposed into a long position\nin stock X and a short position in a risk-free profit rate exposure in the funding\ncurrency. A typical profit rate swap is decomposed into a long position in a fixed\nprofit rate exposure and a short position in a floating one, or vice versa.\n(4) For an SCHI that represents sold protection, the exposure to the\nreferenced name is the difference between the amount that would be\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 313\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 5 Concentration risk and large exposures\nPart 5.2 Large exposures\nRule 5.2.28\ndue if the protection were triggered and the absolute market value of\nthe credit protection.\nGuidance\nIf the market value of an SCHI is positive for the protection seller, that value should\nalso be added to the protection seller’s exposure to the protection buyer. Such a\nsituation could occur if the present value of agreed but unpaid premiums exceeded\nthe absolute market value of the credit protection.\n5.2.28 Exposure values of investments in transactions in trading\nbook\n(1) This rule deals with how an Islamic banking business firm must\ndecide the exposure value of an investment in a transaction (such as\nan index position, a securitisation, a hedge fund or an investment\nfund) that is held in the firm’s trading book.\n(2) The firm must calculate the exposure value of such an investment in\nthe same way as for a similar instrument in the firm’s banking book.\n(3) An Islamic banking business firm may offset positions in different\nissues by the same counterparty only if:\n(a) the short position is junior to the long position; or\n(b) the positions are of the same seniority.\n(4) To determine the relative seniority of positions, the firm may allocate\npositions to broad classes based on seniority.\n(5) If the firm chooses not to allocate its positions to classes as set out in\nsubrule (4), it must not offset long and short positions in different\nissues by the counterparty.\n(6) If the result of the offsetting is a net short position with a single\ncounterparty, that net position need not be treated as an exposure for\nthe purposes of this Part.\n5.2.29 Treatment of hedged positions in trading book\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm’s position is hedged by an SCHI,\nthe firm may take the hedge into account if, for the underlying and\nthe position hedged, the short position is junior to the long position,\nor the positions are of the same seniority.\npage 314 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nConcentration risk and large exposures Chapter 5\nLarge exposures Part 5.2\nRule 5.2.30\n(2) If an Islamic banking business firm’s exposure is hedged by an SCHI,\nany reduction in exposure to the original counterparty is also an\nexposure to the credit protection provider, in accordance with\nrule 5.2.16.\n5.2.30 No netting between banking and trading books\nAn Islamic banking business firm must not net positions between the\nbanking book and trading book.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 315\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.1 General\nRule 6.1.1\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.1 General\nDivision 6.1.A Management of market risk generally\n6.1.1 Introduction\n(1) This Chapter sets out the requirements for an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm’s market risk management policy to identify, measure,\nevaluate, manage and control or mitigate market risk. This Chapter\nalso sets out how to calculate the firm’s market risk capital\nrequirement.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm that operates in a market incurs\nrisks from potential movements in market prices.\n(3) In calculating its capital requirement, an Islamic banking business\nfirm must take into account unexpected losses that may arise from\nmarket risk.\n(4) In determining the value of an asset or liability, the firm must also\nmake appropriate adjustments for uncertainties arising from market\nrisk.\n6.1.2 Role of governing body—market risk\nAn Islamic banking business firm’s governing body must ensure that\nthe firm’s market risk management policy gives the firm a\ncomprehensive firm-wide view of its market risk and takes into\naccount the risk of a significant deterioration in market liquidity.\npage 316 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nGeneral Part 6.1\nRule 6.1.3\n6.1.3 Relation to stress-testing\nWhen carrying out stress-testing or review of stress scenarios, an\nIslamic banking business firm must take into account market risk\nexposures.\n6.1.4 Requirements—capital and management of market risk\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must have capital to cover market\nrisk from positions in its banking and trading books.\n(2) The firm must also have robust market risk measurement and risk\nmanagement.\n6.1.7 Policies—market risk environment\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s market risk management policy\nmust establish:\n(a) effective systems for the accurate and timely identification,\nmeasurement, evaluation, management and control or\nmitigation of market risk, and reporting to the firm’s governing\nbody and senior management;\n(b) prudent and appropriate market risk limits that are consistent\nwith the firm’s risk appetite, risk profile and capital, and with\nthe management’s ability to manage;\n(c) who is responsible for identifying, measuring and reporting\nmarket risk;\n(d) procedures for tracking and reporting exceptions to, and\ndeviations from, limits or policies; and\n(e) procedures for including positions and exposures in the trading\nbook.\n(2) The policy must ensure that all of the firm’s transactions are identified\nand recorded in a timely way and that their valuations are consistent\nand prudent.\nNote For valuation of positions and verification of market prices and model\ninputs, see Division 6.1.B.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 317\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.1 General\nRule 6.1.9\nDivision 6.1.B Measurement of risk and valuation of\npositions\n6.1.9 Standard method to be used\n(1) Unless the Regulatory Authority has approved the use of an internal\nmodel by an Islamic banking business firm, market risk is, as a\ngeneral rule, measured using the standard method. The standard\nmethod comprises a range of approaches that a firm may use to\ncalculate capital charges from its trading activities.\nNote For approval of the use of internal models, see rule 3.1.6.\n(2) In the standard method, market risk capital requirement is the sum\nof the capital charges for:\n(a) foreign exchange risk in the trading book and banking book;\n(b) options risk in the trading book and banking book;\n(c) commodities risk in the trading book and banking book;\n(d) inventory risk in the trading book and banking book;\n(e) traded equity position risk; and\n(f) traded profit rate risk on sukuk and other Shari’a-compliant debt\nsecurities and profit-rate-related instruments.\nNote The measurements of the risks mentioned in (2) are set out in Part 6.2 to\nPart 6.6.\n6.1.10 Valuing positions—mark-to-market\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must use the mark-to-market\nmethod to value its positions and exposures if there is a market to\nmark the positions and exposures to. Mark-to-market means a\nvaluation that is based on current market value.\nGuidance\n1 The Regulatory Authority would expect an Islamic banking business firm to\nmark-to-market listed securities, because there is a market with observable and\nreliable prices for such securities.\npage 318 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nGeneral Part 6.1\nRule 6.1.11\n2 The firm should mark-to-market as much as possible. It should use the prudent\nside of a bid or offer unless the firm is a significant market maker that can\nclose at mid-market.\n3 When estimating fair value, the firm should maximise the use of relevant\nobservable inputs and avoid the use of unobservable inputs.\n(2) A position that is marked-to-market must be revalued daily, based on\nindependently sourced current market prices.\nGuidance\nBecause of the less liquid nature of many sukuk and equity positions held by an\nIslamic banking business firm, it is important for the firm to have prudent valuation\npractices.\n6.1.11 Valuing positions—mark-to-model\n(1) If it is not possible to mark-to-market (for example, in the case of\nunlisted securities or where the market is inactive), an Islamic\nbanking business firm may use the mark-to-model method to value\nits positions and exposures. Mark-to-model means a valuation that\nhas to be benchmarked, extrapolated or otherwise calculated from a\nmarket input.\n(2) The firm must be able to demonstrate that its marking-to-model is\nprudent.\nGuidance\nAn Islamic banking business firm should be extra conservative when marking-to-\nmodel. The Regulatory Authority will take into account the following in deciding\nif the firm’s model is prudent:\n• whether senior management is aware of the positions and exposures that\nare marked to model and whether it understands the uncertainty this might\ncreate in reporting the risk or performance of the business\n• the extent to which market inputs are sourced from market prices\n• the appropriateness of the assumptions used by the firm\n• the availability of generally accepted valuation methods for particular\nproducts\n• who developed the model\n• whether the firm holds a secure copy of the model\n• the existence of formal control procedures for changing the model\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 319\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.1 General\nRule 6.1.12\n• how often the model is used to check valuations\n• how aware is the firm’s risk management function of the weaknesses of\nthe model and how those weaknesses are reflected in the valuation output\n• the results of comparisons between actual close out values and model\noutputs\n• the firm’s procedures for reviewing the model.\n6.1.12 Independent price verification\nAn Islamic banking business firm must independently verify market\nprices and model inputs, to check that those prices and inputs are\naccurate. The verification must be done at least once a month.\nGuidance\n1 Independent price verification is different from daily mark-to-market. The\nobject of the verification is to regularly check the accuracy of market prices or\nmodel inputs and, thereby, eliminate inaccurate daily marks. The verification\nshould be carried out by a unit independent of whoever marked the positions\nor exposures.\n2 The independent marking in the verification process should reveal any error\nor bias in pricing. It entails a higher standard of accuracy in that the market\nprices or model inputs are used to determine profit and loss figures, whereas\ndaily marks are used primarily for management reporting in between reporting\ndates.\n6.1.13 Valuation adjustments\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must consider making adjustments\nfor positions that cannot be prudently valued (such as those that have\nbecome concentrated, less liquid or stale). For example, valuation\nadjustment would be appropriate if pricing sources are more\nsubjective (such as when there is only one available broker quote).\n(2) The firm must establish and maintain procedures for considering\nvaluation adjustments. This rule applies whether:\n(a) the firm uses the mark-to-market or mark-to-model method; and\n(b) whether the valuation is done by the firm itself or a third party.\n(3) The firm must consider the following valuation adjustments:\n(a) unearned profit;\npage 320 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nGeneral Part 6.1\nRule 6.1.14\n(b) close-out costs;\n(c) operational risks;\n(d) early termination;\n(e) investing and funding costs;\n(f) future administrative costs;\n(g) model risk, if relevant;\n(h) any other adjustment that the firm considers appropriate.\nDivision 6.1.C Internal risk transfers\n6.1.14 Meaning of internal risk transfer\nAn internal risk transfer is an internal written record of a transfer of\nrisk:\n(a) within an Islamic banking business firm’s banking book;\n(b) between the firm’s banking and trading book; or\n(c) between different desks within the trading book.\n6.1.15 Capital effect of internal risk transfer from trading book to\nbanking book\nAn internal risk transfer from the trading book to the banking book\nhas no effect on the risk-based capital requirement of the Islamic\nbanking business firm concerned. That is, if the firm makes an\ninternal risk transfer from the trading book to the banking book, the\ntransfer is not to be taken into account when the firm calculates its\nrisk-based capital requirement.\n6.1.16 Capital effect of internal risk transfer of credit and equity\nrisk from banking book to trading book\n(1) This rule applies if an Islamic banking business firm hedges a credit\nrisk or equity risk exposure in the banking book using an SCHI that\nwas purchased through the trading book (that is, using an internal risk\ntransfer).\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 321\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.1 General\nRule 6.1.16\n(2) A credit exposure in the banking book is taken to be hedged for the\npurpose of calculating the firm’s risk-based capital requirement if and\nonly if:\n(a) the trading book enters into an external hedge with an eligible\nprotection provider (see subrule (4)) that exactly matches the\ninternal risk transfer; and\n(b) the external hedge is an eligible SCHI (see subrule (4)) in\nrelation to the banking book exposure.\n(3) An equity exposure in the banking book is taken to be hedged for that\npurpose if and only if:\n(a) the trading book enters into an external hedge from an eligible\nprotection provider that exactly matches the internal risk\ntransfer; and\n(b) the external hedge is recognised as a hedge of a banking book\nequity exposure.\n(4) In subrules (2) and (3):\neligible protection provider means:\n(a) a central counterparty;\n(b) the State of Qatar or any other sovereign;\n(c) an entity that is treated as a sovereign in accordance with the\nBasel Accords;\n(d) a PSE or other entity that has:\n(i) a risk weight of 20% or lower; and\n(ii) a lower risk weight than the party to whom the protection\nis provided; or\n(e) a parent entity, subsidiary or affiliate of a party to whom the\nprotection is provided that has a lower risk weight than the party.\neligible SCHI has the meaning given by rule 4.6.39.\npage 322 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nGeneral Part 6.1\nRule 6.1.17\n(5) For the purposes of this rule, an external hedge may be made up of\nmultiple transactions with multiple counterparties as long as the total\nexternal hedge exactly matches the internal risk transfer.\n(6) If the requirements in subrule (2) are satisfied, the banking book\nexposure is treated, for capital purposes in the banking book, as being\nhedged by the banking book leg of the transfer. Both the trading book\nleg of the transfer and the external hedge must be included in the\nmarket risk capital requirements.\n(7) If the requirements in subrule (2) are not satisfied, the banking book\nexposure is not treated, for capital purposes in the banking book, as\nbeing hedged by the banking book leg of the transfer. The third-party\nexternal hedge must be fully included in, and the trading book leg of\nthe transfer must be fully excluded from, the market risk capital\nrequirements.\n(8) A banking book short credit or equity position that was created by an\ninternal risk transfer and is not capitalised under banking book rules\nmust be capitalised under the market risk rules together with the\ntrading book exposure.\nGuidance\nA banking book instrument that is over-hedged by an internal risk transfer creates\na short (risk) position in the banking book.\n6.1.17 Internal risk transfer of general profit rate risk\n(1) This rule applies if an Islamic banking business firm hedges a general\nprofit rate risk (GPRR) exposure in the banking book using an\ninternal risk transfer with its trading book.\n(2) The trading book leg of the transfer is treated as a trading book\ninstrument under the market risk framework if (and only if):\n(a) the transfer is documented in relation to the profit rate risk that\nis being hedged and the sources of that risk;\n(b) the transfer is done with a dedicated internal risk transfer trading\ndesk that has been specifically approved by the Regulatory\nAuthority for the purpose; and\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 323\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nGeneral\nRule 6.1.18\n(c) the transfer is subject to trading book capital requirements under\nthe market risk framework on a stand-alone basis for the\ndedicated internal risk transfer desk, separate from any other\nGPRR or other market risks generated by activities in the trading\nbook.\n(3) If the requirements in subrule (2) are satisfied, the banking book leg\nof the transfer must be included in the banking book’s measure of\nprofit rate risk exposures for regulatory capital purposes.\n(4) The internal risk transfer desk may include instruments purchased\nfrom the market. Such purchases may be executed directly between\nthe desk and the market.\n(5) Alternatively, the internal risk transfer desk may obtain the external\nhedge from the market by a separate non-internal risk transfer trading\ndesk acting as an agent, if and only if the GPRR internal risk transfer\nentered into with the non-internal desk exactly matches the external\nhedge from the market. In this case the respective legs of the GPRR\ninternal risk transfer are included in the capital calculations of both\nthe internal risk transfer desk and the non-internal risk transfer desk.\n6.1.18 Internal risk transfers within scope of application of\nmarket risk capital requirement\n(1) Internal risk transfers between an Islamic banking business firm’s\ninternal risk transfer desk and other trading desks receive regulatory\ncapital recognition only if the conditions in rule 6.1.17 (2) are\nsatisfied.\n(2) The trading book leg of an internal risk transfer must fulfil the same\nrequirements in rule 6.1.17 (2) as an instrument in the trading book\ntransacted with an external counterparty.\npage 324 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nForeign exchange risk Part 6.2\nRule 6.2.1\nPart 6.2 Foreign exchange risk\n6.2.1 Relation to market risk\n(1) In measuring its market risk, an Islamic banking business firm must\ninclude the risk of holding or taking positions in foreign currencies,\ngold and silver (foreign exchange risk). Foreign exchange risk may\narise from the firm’s trading in the foreign exchange market and other\nmarkets; it may also arise from non-trading activities that are\ndenominated in a foreign currency.\nGuidance\n1 If an Islamic banking business firm is exposed to profit rate risk on positions\nin foreign currencies, gold and silver, the firm must include the relevant profit\nrate positions in the calculation of profit rate risk in the trading book—see\nrule 6.6.2(4).\n2 Unlike Basel II, silver and gold are treated under Shari’a as foreign exchange\npositions (rather than as commodity positions). In Basel II, only gold is treated\nin that way.\n(2) If foreign currency is to be received or delivered under a binding\nunilateral promise, the firm must report any profit rate exposure from\nthe other leg of the contract in accordance with Part 6.6 (profit rate\nrisk in the trading book).\n(3) If gold or silver is to be received or delivered under a binding\nunilateral promise, the firm must report any foreign currency or profit\nrate exposure from the other leg of the contract in accordance with\nthis Part or Part 6.6, as the case requires.\n6.2.2 What to include in foreign exchange risk\n(1) In calculating the capital charge for foreign exchange risk, an Islamic\nbanking business firm must include in its exposure to each foreign\ncurrency:\n(a) the net spot position (that is, assets minus liabilities denominated\nin the currency, including accrued profit and other accrued\nincome and accrued expenses);\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 325\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.2 Foreign exchange risk\nRule 6.2.2\n(b) the net position of binding unilateral promises by the firm to buy\nor sell currencies on a specified future date (that are not included\nin the spot position);\nExamples of amounts to be received or paid\n• the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position\n• profit from swaps and other profit rate transactions.\n(c) irrevocable guarantees (and similar instruments) that are certain\nto be called and likely to be irrecoverable; and\n(d) any other items representing an exposure to risk in foreign\ncurrencies (for example a specific provision held in the currency\nin question where the underlying asset is held in a different\ncurrency).\n(2) The firm may also include in its currency exposure any net future\nincome or expenses that are not yet accrued but already fully hedged.\nIf the firm includes such income or expenses, it must do so\nconsistently and must not select only expected future flows that\nreduce its position.\n(3) If the firm has deliberately taken a position to partly or totally protect\nitself against the adverse effect of a change in an exchange rate on its\ncapital adequacy ratio, it may exclude the position from its currency\nexposure insofar as it relates to that hedge, if:\n(a) the position is of a structural and non-trading nature;\n(b) the structural position does no more than protect the firm’s\ncapital adequacy ratio;\n(c) the position cannot be traded for speculative or profit-making\npurposes;

and\n(c) an investment in an overseas subsidiary or other entity in the\nsame corporate group as the firm that, under these rules, is\ndeducted from the firm’s capital for capital adequacy purposes.\n(5) The firm must also include any currency exposures arising from\nequity, commodity and profit rate positions.\n6.2.3 Foreign exchange risk on consolidated basis\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm is assessing its foreign exchange\nrisk on a consolidated basis, and the inclusion of the currency\npositions of a marginal operation of the firm is technically\nimpractical, the firm may use, as a proxy for those positions, the\ninternal limit in each currency that the firm applies to the operation.\nMarginal operation, in relation to a firm, is an operation of the firm\nthat accounts for less than 5% of the firm’s total currency positions.\n(2) The absolute values of the limits must be added to the net open\nposition in each currency, but only if the actual positions are\nadequately monitored against those internal limits.\n6.2.4 Capital charge—foreign exchange risk\n(1) For an Islamic banking business firm that does not write options, net\nopen position in a foreign currency is the sum of:\n(a) the firm’s currency exposures under rule 6.2.2 for the currency;\nand\n(b) the value of the options and their associated underlying assets\nmeasured using the simplified approach in Division 6.3.B.\n(2) For an Islamic banking business firm that writes options, net open\nposition in a foreign currency is the sum of:\n(a) the firm’s currency exposures under rule 6.2.2 for the currency;\nand\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 327\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.2 Foreign exchange risk\nRule 6.2.4\n(b) either:\n(i) the net delta-based equivalent of the firm’s total book of\nforeign currency options (with separately calculated\ncapital charges for gamma risk and vega risk under\nDivision 6.3.C); or\n(ii) the value of the options and their associated underlying\nassets under the delta-plus method in Division 6.3.C.\n(3) The firm must calculate its overall foreign currency net open\nposition by:\n(a) calculating the net open position in each foreign currency;\n(b) converting the nominal amount (or net present value) of each\nsuch net position into Qatari riyals at the current spot market\nexchange rate;\n(c) adding all short net positions and adding all long net positions\ncalculated under paragraphs (a) and (b); and\n(d) selecting the greater of the absolute values of the 2 sums in\nparagraph (c).\n(4) The firm must then calculate its net position in gold and silver by:\n(a) valuing all gold and silver positions using the US dollar current\nspot price (regardless of maturity);\n(b) offsetting long and short positions; and\n(c) converting the absolute value of the resulting net position into\nQatari riyals.\n(5) To convert the net position in gold and silver into Qatari riyals, the\nfirm must state the position (spot plus forward) in a standard unit of\nmeasurement and then convert the net position at the current spot\nmarket exchange rate.\n(6) The capital charge for foreign exchange risk of an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm is the sum of:\n(a) 8% of the firm’s overall foreign currency net open position in\neach of the foreign currencies it holds;

or\n(b) rule 6.3.5 for a position that is a ‘long put’ or ‘long call’ position.\nGuidance\nIn the simplified approach, the position in the option and the associated underlying\nasset (cash or forward) is not subject to the mark-to-market method. Instead, each\npage 330 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nOptions risk Part 6.3\nRule 6.3.4\nposition is carved-out and is subject to a separately calculated capital charge for\nspecific risk and general risk.\n6.3.4 Capital charges—‘long cash and long put’ or ‘short cash\nand long call’\n(1) For a position that is ‘long cash and long put’ or ‘short cash and long\ncall’, the capital charge is calculated by multiplying the market value\nof the underlying security by the sum of the specific and general risk\ncapital charges for the underlying, and then subtracting the amount\nby which the option is in-the-money (bounded at zero).\nGuidance\n1 In cases (such as foreign exchange transactions) where it is unclear which side\nis the underlying security, the underlying should be taken to be the asset that\nwould be received if the option were exercised. In addition, the nominal value\nshould be used for items if the market value of the underlying instrument could\nbe zero (such as in caps, floors and swaptions).\n2 Some options have no specific risk (such as those having a profit rate, currency\nor commodity as the underlying security); other options on profit-rate-related\ninstruments and options on equities and stock indices, however, would have\nspecific risk.\n(2) In the simplified approach, the capital charge is:\n(a) 8% for options on currency; and\n(b) 15% for options on commodities.\n(3) For options with a residual maturity of less than 6 months, an Islamic\nbanking business firm must use the forward price (instead of the spot\nprice) if it is able to do so.\n(4) For options with a residual maturity of more than 6 months, the firm\nmust compare the strike price with the forward price (instead of the\ncurrent price). If the firm is unable to do this, it must take the in-the-\nmoney amount to be zero.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 331\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.3 Options risk\nRule 6.3.5\n6.3.5 Capital charges—‘long put’ or ‘long call’\n(1) For a position that is ‘long put’ or ‘long call’, the capital charge is the\nlesser of:\n(a) the market value of the underlying security multiplied by the\nsum of the specific and general risk capital charges for the\nunderlying; and\n(b) the market value of the option.\n(2) For subrule (1) (b), the book value of the option may be used instead\nof the market value if the position is not included in the trading book\n(for example, options on particular foreign exchange or commodities\npositions).\nDivision 6.3.C Delta-plus method\n6.3.6 Using delta-plus method\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm that writes options must calculate\nspecific risk capital charges separately by multiplying the delta-\nequivalent value of each option by the risk-weight applicable under\nDivision 6.4.B (equity position risk) and Part 6.6 (profit rate risk in\nthe trading book).\n(2) In calculating general risk capital charge, the firm must enter delta-\nweighted positions with a debt security or profit rate as the underlying\ninto the profit rate time bands in table 6.6.8A by using a two-legged\napproach. Under this approach, there is 1 entry at the time the\nunderlying contract takes effect and a second entry at the time the\nunderlying contract matures.\n(3) For an option with a debt security as the underlying, the firm must\napply a specific risk capital charge to the delta-weighted position\nbased on the issuer’s rating and in accordance with Part 6.6.\n6.3.7 Relation to mark-to-market method\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm that writes options must include\ndelta-weighted option positions in measuring its market risk.\npage 332 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nOptions risk Part 6.3\nRule 6.3.8\n(2) The firm must report such an option as a position equal to the sum of\nthe market values of the underlying multiplied by the sum of the\nabsolute values of the deltas. Because delta does not cover all risks\nassociated with option positions, the firm must calculate gamma and\nvega in calculating the regulatory capital charge.\nNote Gamma is the rate of change of delta with respect to a change in the price\nof the underlying. Vega is the sensitivity of the value of an option to a\nchange in the volatility of the underlying.\n(3) The firm must calculate delta, gamma and vega using the pricing\nmodel used by a recognised exchange, or a proprietary options pricing\nmodel approved, in writing, by the Regulatory Authority.\n6.3.8 Capital charges—options\n(1) The capital charge for an option with equities as the underlying must\nbe based on the delta-weighted positions included in the measurement\nof specific and general risks in accordance with Division 6.4.B\n(equity position risk).\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm that writes options must calculate\nthe capital charge for options on foreign exchange and gold and silver\npositions in accordance with Part 6.2 (foreign exchange risk). For\ndelta risk, the net delta-based equivalent of the foreign currency, gold\nand silver options must be included in the measurement of the\nexposure for the respective currency, gold or silver position.\n(3) The capital charge for an option on commodities must be based on\nthe charge calculated using the simplified approach in rule 6.4.6.\n6.3.9 Gamma capital charges\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm that writes options must calculate\nthe capital charge for gamma risk (gamma capital charge) for each\noption position separately.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 333\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.3 Options risk\nRule 6.3.9\n(2) To calculate gamma capital charge, calculate the gamma impact of\neach option in accordance with the following formula:\nGamma impact = × gamma × VU2\nwhere:\nVU is:\n(a) for a profit rate option:\n(i) if the option has a bond as the underlying—the market\nvalue of the underlying multiplied by the risk factor\napplicable under column 3 of table 6.6.8A; or\n(ii) if the option has a profit rate as the underlying—the market\nvalue of the underlying multiplied by the assumed changes\nin yield in column 4 of table 6.6.8A;\n(b) for options on equities and stock indices—the market value of\nthe underlying multiplied by 8%;\n(c) for options on foreign exchange, gold and silver—the market\nvalue of the underlying multiplied by 8%; or\n(d) for an option on commodities—the market value of the\nunderlying multiplied by 15%.\n(3) In calculating the gamma impact for an option mentioned in the\ndefinition of VU, the firm must treat as the same underlying:\n(a) for profit rates—each time band in column 2 of table 6.6.8A\n(with each position allocated to separate maturity ladders);\n(b) for equities and stock indices—each recognised exchange;\n(c) for foreign currencies, gold and silver—each currency pair, gold\nand silver; and\n(d) for commodities—each individual commodity of a kind\ndescribed in rule 6.4.2(3) (a) or (b).\npage 334 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n1\n2\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nOptions risk Part 6.3\nRule 6.3.10\n(4) Each option on the same underlying described in subrules (2) and (3)\nwill have a gamma impact that is positive or negative. The firm must\nadd the individual gamma impacts, resulting in a net gamma impact\nfor each underlying that is either positive or negative.\n(5) To calculate the firm’s total gamma capital charge, exclude gamma\nimpacts that are positive. The total gamma capital charge is the sum\nof the absolute values of the net negative gamma impacts.\n6.3.10 Vega capital charges\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm that writes options must calculate\nthe capital charge for vega risk (vega capital charge) for each option\nposition separately.\n(2) To calculate vega capital charge, the firm must multiply the vega for\neach option mentioned in the definition of VU in rule 6.3.9(2) by a\n25% proportional shift in the option’s current volatility. The results\nmust then be summed across each underlying.\n(3) The total vega capital charge is the sum of the absolute values of the\nvega capital charges across each underlying.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 335\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.4 Commodities risk and inventory risk\nRule 6.4.1\nPart 6.4 Commodities risk and inventory\nrisk\nDivision 6.4.A Commodities risk\n6.4.1 Relation to market risk\n(1) In measuring its market risk, an Islamic banking business firm must\ninclude the risk of holding or taking positions in commodities and\ncommodities options (commodities risk).\nGuidance\n1 If an Islamic banking business firm is exposed to foreign exchange or profit\nrate risk from funding commodities positions, the firm must include the\nrelevant positions in the measurement of profit rate or foreign exchange risk—\nsee rules 6.2.2 (5) and 6.6.2 (4), respectively.\n2 Gold is not treated as a commodity (see the definition of commodity in the\nGlossary). Gold is dealt with as a foreign exchange position (rather than as a\ncommodity position) because the volatility of its prices is similar to that of a\ncurrency.\n(3) If a commodity is to be received or delivered under a binding\nunilateral promise, the firm must report any foreign currency, equity\nor profit rate exposure from the other leg of the contract in accordance\nwith Part 6.2, Division 6.4.B or Part 6.6, as the case requires.\n6.4.2 Measuring commodities risk\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must use the simplified approach\nto measure commodities risk.\n(2) To calculate open positions using this approach, the firm may report\nshort and long positions in each commodity on a net basis. Positions\nare reported on a net basis by offsetting them against each other in\naccordance with subrule (3).\n(3) Positions in the same commodity may be offset. Positions in different\ncommodities must not be offset unless:\n(a) the commodities are deliverable against each other; or\npage 336 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nCommodities risk and inventory risk Part 6.4\nRule 6.4.3\n(b) the commodities are close substitutes for each other and a\nminimum correlation between price movements of 0.9 can be\nclearly established over at least the preceding year.\nAn Islamic banking business firm must not use the correlation-based\noffsetting mentioned in paragraph (b) unless the Regulatory Authority\nhas, in writing, allowed the firm to use it.\n6.4.3 Measuring net positions\nAn Islamic banking business firm must first state each commodity\nposition (spot plus forward) in terms of the standard unit of\nmeasurement for the commodity (such as barrels, kilos or grams). The\nfirm must then convert the net position in each commodity into Qatari\nriyals at the current spot market exchange rates.\n6.4.4 What to include in commodities risk\n(1) In calculating the capital charge for commodities risk, an Islamic\nbanking business firm must include commodity Shari’a-compliant\nhedging instruments and off-balance-sheet positions that are affected\nby changes in commodity prices (such commodity swaps). The firm\nmust include commodities risk arising from salam contracts.\n(2) Options on commodities for which the options risk is measured using\nthe delta-plus method must also be included (with their underlying\nassets). Options for which the options risk is measured using the\nsimplified approach must be excluded.\n(3) The firm must convert commodity Shari’a-compliant hedging\ninstruments into notional commodities positions and assign them to\nmaturities under rule 6.4.5.\n6.4.5 Assigning notional positions to maturities\nBinding unilateral promises relating to a particular commodity must\nbe included in the measurement of commodities risk as notional\namounts in terms of the standard unit of measurement multiplied by\nthe spot price of the commodity.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 337\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.4 Commodities risk and inventory risk\nRule 6.4.6\n6.4.6 Capital charges—simplified approach\n(1) The capital charge for commodities risk of an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm is the sum of:\n(a) 15% on the firm’s overall net position, long or short, in each\ncommodity; and\n(b) 3% on the firm’s gross position in each commodity.\n(2) Gross position, of a firm in a commodity, is the sum of the absolute\nvalues of all short positions and all long positions of the firm,\nregardless of maturity.\n(3) The firm must use the current spot price to calculate its gross position\nin commodity Shari’a-compliant hedging instruments.\nDivision 6.4.B Inventory risk\n6.4.7 Relation to market risk\nIn measuring its market risk, an Islamic banking business firm must\ninclude the risk of holding assets in inventory with a view to reselling\nthem under a murabahah contract or for leasing them under an ijarah\ncontract (inventory risk).\n6.4.8 Measuring inventory risk\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must use the simplified approach\nto measure inventory risk.\n(2) The capital charge for inventory risk of an Islamic banking business\nfirm is 15% of the value of the assets held by the firm in inventory\nwith a view to resale or lease.\nNote For capital charges for inventory risk that may arise for work-in-process\nunder istisna contracts, see rule 6.7.5 and rule 6.7.6.\npage 338 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nEquity position risk Part 6.5\nRule 6.5.1\nPart 6.5 Equity position risk\n6.5.1 Relation to market risk\n(1) In measuring its market risk, an Islamic banking business firm must\ninclude the risk of holding or taking positions in equities (equity\nposition risk).\nNote For the treatment of options with equities as the underlying, see\nrule 6.3.8(1). Under that rule, this Part on equity position risk applies to\nthe option, but the capital charge must be based on the delta-weighted\npositions included in the measurement of specific and general risks.\n(2) If equities are to be received or delivered under a binding unilateral\npromise, the firm must report any foreign currency or profit rate\nexposure from the other leg of the contract in accordance with Part\n6.2 or Part 6.6, as the case requires.\nGuidance\nIf an Islamic banking business firm is exposed to profit rate risk on equity positions,\nthe firm must include the relevant profit rate positions in the calculation of profit\nrate risk in the trading book—see rule 6.6.2(4).\n6.5.2 Measuring equity position risk\n(1) The measurement of equity position risk in the trading book applies\nto short and long positions in all instruments that exhibit market\nbehaviour similar to equities.\nExamples of instruments with equity-like behaviour\n• common shares (whether voting or non-voting)\n• investments in Islamic collective investment funds\n• convertible securities and commitments to buy or sell equity securities\n• convertible sukuk that trade like equities.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm may report short and long positions\nin instruments relating to the same issuer on a net basis.\n(3) The firm must calculate the long or short position in the equity market\non a market-by-market basis. That is, the firm must make a separate\ncapital calculation for each exchange in which it holds equities\n(whether or not a recognised exchange).\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 339\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.5 Equity position risk\nRule 6.5.3\n6.5.3 What to include in equity position risk\n(1) In calculating the capital charge for equity position risk, an Islamic\nbanking business firm must include equity Shari’a-compliant hedging\ninstruments and off-balance-sheet positions that are affected by\nchanges in equity prices.\n(2) To calculate the charges for equity position risk for equity Shari’a-\ncompliant hedging instruments and other off-balance-sheet positions,\nthe firm must convert positions into notional equity positions, so that:\n(a) equity Shari’a-compliant hedging instruments and off-balance-\nsheet positions relating to individual equities are reported at\ncurrent market prices;\n(b) equity Shari’a-compliant hedging instruments and off-balance-\nsheet positions relating to stock indices are reported as the mark-\nto-market value of the notional underlying equity portfolio; and\n(c) equity swaps are treated as 2 notional positions.\n6.5.4 Charges for specific and general risks\n(1) The capital charge for equity position risk consists of 2 separately\ncalculated charges:\n(a) a charge for the specific risk of holding a long or short position\nin an individual equity; and\n(b) a charge for the general risk of holding a long or short position\nin the market as a whole.\n(2) The capital charge for specific risk is 8% on the gross position of an\nIslamic banking business firm in equities listed on a recognised\nexchange and 12% on the gross position of the firm in other equities.\nGross position, of a firm in an equity market, is the sum of the\nabsolute values of all short equity positions and all long equity\npositions of the firm.\n(3) The capital charge for general risk is 8% on the net position of an\nIslamic banking business firm. Net position, of a firm in an equity\nmarket, is the difference between long equity positions and short\nequity positions of the firm.\npage 340 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nEquity position risk Part 6.5\nRule 6.5.5\n(4) Equity position is the net of short and long exposures to an individual\ncompany.

For this purpose, a future in an equity may be offset against\nan opposite physical position in the same equity.\n6.5.6 Charges for index contracts\n(1) For an index contract on an index that an Islamic banking business\nfirm considers diversified, the firm must apply a general risk capital\ncharge of 8%, and a specific risk capital charge of 2%, to the net long\nor short position in the contract.\n(2) For any other index contract, the firm must apply a general risk capital\ncharge of 8%, and a specific risk capital charge of 4%, to the net long\nor short position in the contract.\n(3) If required to do so by the Regulatory Authority, the firm must\ndemonstrate why the firm considers an index to be a diversified index.\nGuidance\nAn Islamic banking business firm should test diversification against the following\ncriteria used by the European Banking Authority:\n• The index must have a minimum number of equities. There must be an\nabsolute threshold below which the index cannot be considered\nsufficiently diversified to ignore the specific risk completely.\n• None of the equities must significantly influence the volatility of the\nindex.

However, a specific risk capital charge must be\ncalculated if the underlying is a debt security or an index representing\na basket of debt securities.\n(2) Forward contracts and binding unilateral promises (other than those\nin foreign exchange transactions) are exempt from specific risk\ncapital charges if:\n(a) the Islamic banking business firm has a right to substitute cash\nsettlement for physical delivery under the contract; and\n(b) the price on settlement is calculated with reference to a general\nmarket price indicator.\n(3) A contract or promise that is exempt under subrule (2) must not be\noffset against specific securities (including those securities that make\nup the market index).\nDivision 6.6.C General risk\n6.6.6 Measuring general risk\n(1) General risk is measured using the maturity method. In that method,\npositions are allocated to a maturity ladder before the capital charge\nis calculated.\n(2) The firm must add the absolute values of the individual net positions\nwithin each time band, whether long or short. The sum of the absolute\nvalues is the firm’s gross position.\n6.6.7 Maturity method\n(1) In the maturity method, long or short positions in debt securities,\nShari’a-compliant hedging instruments and other sources of profit\npage 348 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nProfit rate risk in the trading book Part 6.6\nRule 6.6.8\nrate exposures are allocated to the time bands in table 6.6.8A (and\nthen to the zones in table 6.6.8B) based on residual maturity and profit\nrate.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm must allocate:\n(a) positions in fixed-rate instruments according to their residual\nterm to maturity;

Positions in different\ncurrencies are not to be offset.\n(2) If the firm’s position in a currency is less than 5% of the value of the\nfirm’s banking book assets, that currency is taken to be a residual\ncurrency and the firm may use a single maturity ladder for all residual\ncurrencies (instead of having to use separate maturity ladders for each\ncurrency). The firm must enter, into each appropriate time band, the\nnet long or short position for residual currencies.\n(3) The firm must apply, with no further offsets, the risk factor in\ncolumn 3 of table 6.6.8A to the position in each time band for residual\ncurrencies.\n6.6.10 Binding unilateral promises\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must treat a binding unilateral\npromise on bank or corporate debt as a long position or a short\nposition in the underlying debt security. A binding unilateral promise\nthat is not on bank or corporate debt must be treated as a long position\nor a short position in a notional government security.\n(2) If a range of instruments may be delivered to fulfil a contract, the firm\nmay choose the deliverable security to be allocated to the maturity\nladder. The firm must, however, take account of any conversion\nfactor specified by the exchange where the instrument must be\ndelivered.\n6.6.11 Swaps\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must treat a swap as 2 notional\npositions in government securities with maturities. Both legs of the\nswap must be reported at their market values.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 353\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.6 Profit rate risk in the trading book\nRule 6.6.12\n(2) For swaps that pay or receive a fixed or floating profit rate against\nsome other reference price (for example, a stock index), the firm\nmust:\n(a) enter the profit rate component into the appropriate maturity\ncategory; and\n(b) include any equity component in the measurement of equity risk.\n(3) Each leg of a cross-currency swap must be reported in the maturity\nladder for the currency concerned. The capital charge for any foreign\nexchange risk arising from the swaps must be calculated in\naccordance with rules 6.2.2 to 6.2.5.\n6.6.12 Shari’a-compliant hedging instruments\n(1) In the measurement of profit rate risk in the trading book, an Islamic\nbanking business firm must include profit rate Shari’a-compliant\nhedging instruments and off-balance-sheet instruments in the trading\nbook if those instruments react to changes in profit rates.\n(2) The firm must convert Shari’a-compliant hedging instruments into\npositions in the relevant underlying to enable the firm to calculate\nspecific and general risk capital charges. To determine the capital\ncharges, the value of the positions must be the market value of the\nunderlying or notional underlying.\n(3) Positions in Shari’a-compliant hedging instruments are subject to\ncharges for general risk in the same way as cash positions. However,\nmatched positions are exempt from the charges if the positions satisfy\nthe criteria in rule 6.6.13 or 6.6.14.\n(4) Positions in Shari’a-compliant hedging instruments must be allocated\nto a maturity ladder and treated in accordance with this rule and the\nmaturity method.\n6.6.13 Criteria for matching Shari’a-compliant hedging\ninstrument positions\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may offset a matched position in\nShari’a-compliant hedging instruments if the positions relate to the\npage 354 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nMarket risk Chapter 6\nProfit rate risk in the trading book Part 6.6\nRule 6.6.13\nsame underlying instruments, have the same nominal value and are\ndenominated in the same currency.\n(2) For swaps and binding unilateral promises:\n(a) the reference rate (for floating-rate positions) must be identical\nand the profit rate must differ by no more than 15 basis points;\nand\n(b) the next profit-fixing date (or, for fixed-profit-rate positions or\nbinding unilateral promises, the residual maturity) must comply\nwith the following requirements:\n(i) if either instrument has a profit-fixing date or residual\nmaturity up to and including 1 month in the future, the\ndates or residual maturities must be the same for both\ninstruments;\n(ii) if either instrument has a profit-fixing date or residual\nmaturity more than 1 month, but no more than 1 year, in\nthe future, the dates or residual maturities must be within\n7 days of each other;\n(iii) if either instrument has a profit-fixing date or residual\nmaturity more than 1 year in the future, the dates or\nresidual maturities must be within 30 days of each other.\nNote 1 For paragraph (a), the separate legs of different swaps may\nbe ‘matched’ subject to these same conditions.\nNote 2 For paragraph (b), spot or cash positions in the same currency\nmay be offset subject to these same conditions.\n(3) An Islamic banking business firm that writes options may offset the\ndelta-equivalent values of options (including the delta-equivalent\nvalue of legs arising out of the treatment of caps and floors in\naccordance with rule 6.3.6).\n(4) However, for offsetting between a matched position in a binding\nunilateral promise and its underlying, rule 6.6.14 applies.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 355\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 6 Market risk\nPart 6.6 Profit rate risk in the trading book\nRule 6.6.14\n6.6.14 Criteria for offsetting Shari’a-compliant hedging\ninstrument positions\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may offset long and short positions\n(whether actual or notional) in identical instruments with exactly the\nsame issuer, profit rate, currency and maturity.\n(2) The firm may offset a matched position in a binding unilateral\npromise and its corresponding underlying.

For sukuk, the risk may adversely\naffect the marketability (and, therefore, the value) of the sukuk.\n2 Shari’a non-compliance risk can take 2 forms:\n• the risk relating to potential non-compliance with Shari’a rules and\nprinciples in the firm’s operations, including the risk that non-\npermissible income is recognised; and\n• the risk relating to the firm’s fiduciary responsibilities as mudarib\ntowards fund providers under a mudarabah contract, according to\nwhich, in the case of negligence, misconduct, fraud or breach of contract\nby the mudarib, the funds provided by the fund providers become a\nliability of the mudarib.\n3 Although the operational risk that could arise for Islamic banking business\nfirms can be considered similar to that of conventional banks, the\ncharacteristics of such risk may be different, thus:\n• Shari’a-compliant products may involve processing steps different from\nthose of their conventional counterparts\n• the assets held on the balance sheets of Islamic banking business firms\n(physical assets and real estate) are different from those of conventional\nbanks\n• the requirements of Shari’a compliance result in different risks relating\nto information technology products and systems.\n4 For examples of Shari’a requirements that must be complied with by an\nIslamic banking business firm in relation to Islamic financial contracts, see\nPart 7.5. Failure to comply with the requirements gives rise to Shari’a non-\ncompliance risk.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 363\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nPart 7.3 Collection and reporting of operational loss data\nRule 7.3.1\nPart 7.3 Collection and reporting of\noperational loss data\n7.3.1 Basic requirement—operational loss dataset\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must have documented procedures\nand processes to identify, collect and treat internal loss data for\noperational risk events. However, the firm need not collect data on\nany operational risk event for which the gross amount of loss is less\nthan QR 40,000.\n(2) In this Chapter, the set of data resulting from that collection is called\nthe firm’s operational loss dataset.\n(3) The procedures and processes:\n(a) must be subject to validation before the dataset is used to\ncalculate the firm’s operational risk capital requirement; and\n(b) must be regularly independently reviewed by the firm’s internal\nor external audit functions.\n(4) The procedures and processes must provide for the collection of at\nleast the following information for an operational risk event:\n(a) the gross amount of the resulting loss (the gross loss);\n(b) if available, the date when the event happened or began (date of\noccurrence);\n(c) the date when the firm became aware of the event (date of\ndiscovery);\n(d) the date (or dates) when the event resulted in a loss, reserve or\nprovision against a loss being recognised in the firm’s profit and\nloss accounts (date of accounting);\n(e) any recovery of the gross loss;\n(f) descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the event.\n(5) The level of detail of the information the firm collects about an event\nmust be proportionate to the gross loss amount resulting from the\nevent.\npage 364 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nCollection and reporting of operational loss data Part 7.3\nRule 7.3.2\n(6) When building the dataset, the firm must use the date of accounting\nas the date of a loss (except that, in the case of a legal loss event (that\nis, a legal event that results in a loss), the bank must use a date no\nlater than the date of accounting).\n(7) If 2 or more losses:\n(a) had the same operational risk event in common as a cause; or\n(b) were caused by related operational risk events over time, but\nwere posted to the accounts over several years;\nthe losses must be allocated to the corresponding years of the loss\ndatabase, in line with their accounting treatment.\n(8) Data on losses that result from mergers or acquisitions must be\nincluded in the dataset.\n(9) The following are not to be included in the dataset:\n(a) costs of general maintenance on property, plant or equipment;\n(b) internal or external expenditure to enhance the firm’s business\nafter operational risk losses (such as upgrades, improvements,\nrisk assessment initiatives and enhancements);\n(c) takaful fees or premiums.\n7.3.2 Meaning of gross loss, recovery and net loss for\noperational risk events\n(1) The gross loss for an operational risk event is the loss resulting from\nthe event before any kind of recovery. Gross loss from such an event\nincludes:\n(a) any direct charge (including any impairment or settlement) to\nthe relevant firm’s profit and loss accounts;\n(b) costs incurred as a result of the event, including expenses\ndirectly linked to the event (such as legal expenses and fees paid\nto advisors or suppliers) and costs of repairs or replacements;\n(c) provisions or reserves accounted for in the profit and loss\naccounts against the loss;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 365\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nPart 7.3 Collection and reporting of operational loss data\nRule 7.3.3\n(d) losses temporarily booked in transitory or suspense accounts and\nnot yet reflected in the profit and loss accounts;\n(e) negative economic effects, booked in an accounting period,\nresulting from operational risk events affecting cash flows or\nfinancial statements in previous accounting periods.\n(2) A recovery for an operational risk event is an independent occurrence,\nrelated to the event, but separate in time, in which funds, or inflows\nof economic benefits, are received from a third party.\nExamples\npayments received from takaful entities\nrepayments received from perpetrators of fraud\nrecoveries of misdirected transfers\n(3) The net loss for an operational risk event is the loss resulting from the\nevent after any recovery.\n7.3.3 Reporting to Regulatory Authority\nThe Regulatory Authority may, by notice given to an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm, require the firm to report internal loss data in the level 1\ncategories set out in Annex 9, Detailed loss event classification, to\nInternational Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital\nStandards: A Revised Framework Comprehensive Version, published\nby the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in June 2006.\npage 366 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nOperational risk capital requirement Part 7.4\nRule 7.4.3\nPart 7.4 Operational risk capital\nrequirement\nDivision 7.4.B Standardised approach\n7.4.3 Commencement—Division 7.4.B\nThis Division commences on 1 January 2023.\n7.4.4 Standardised approach—calculation\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must use the standardised approach\nto operational risk. Operational risk capital requirement is the\namount of capital that the firm must have to cover its operational risk.\n(2) The standardised approach is based on the following factors:\n(a) the business indicator (BI), which is a financial-statement-\nbased proxy for operational risk;\n(b) the business indicator component (BIC), which is calculated by\nmultiplying the BI by a set of marginal coefficients;\n(c) the internal loss multiplier (ILM), which is a scaling factor that\nis based on a firm’s average historical losses and the BIC.\n(3) The business indicator is the sum of:\n(a) the profit, ijarah instalments and dividend component (PIDC);\n(b) the services component (SC): and\n(c) the financial component (FC);\nwhere PIDC, SC and FC are calculated as set out in rule 7.4.5.\n7.4.5 Calculation of PIDC, SC and FC\n(1) In a formula in this rule, a bar above a term means that the term is to\nbe calculated as the average of the relevant quantity over the current\naccounting year and the 2 previous accounting years of the firm\nconcerned.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 367\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nPart 7.4 Operational risk capital requirement\nRule 7.4.5\n(2) The factors PIDC, SC and FC are calculated in accordance with the\nfollowing formulas:\n𝑃𝐼𝐷𝐶 = 𝑀𝑖𝑛 [̅𝐴̅𝑏̅̅𝑠̅ ̅(̅𝑝̅̅𝑟̅𝑜̅̅𝑓̅̅𝑖̅𝑡̅ ̅𝑒̅𝑎̅̅𝑟̅𝑛̅̅𝑒̅𝑑̅̅ ̅–̅̅ ̅𝑒̅𝑥̅̅𝑝̅𝑒̅̅𝑛̅̅𝑠̅𝑒̅̅𝑠̅ ̅𝑝̅𝑎̅̅𝑖̅𝑑̅); 2.25% ̅𝑝̅𝑟̅̅𝑜̅𝑓̅̅𝑖̅𝑡̅ ̅𝑒̅𝑎̅̅𝑟̅𝑛̅̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑔̅̅ 𝑎̅̅𝑠̅𝑠̅̅𝑒̅𝑡̅𝑠̅]\n+̅ 𝑑̅̅𝑖̅𝑣̅̅𝑖𝑑̅̅𝑒̅̅𝑛̅𝑑̅̅ ̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑐̅𝑜̅̅𝑚̅̅𝑒̅\n𝑆𝐶 =𝑀𝑎𝑥 [̅𝑂̅̅𝑡̅ℎ̅̅𝑒̅𝑟̅̅ 𝑜̅̅𝑝̅̅𝑒̅𝑟̅̅𝑎̅𝑡̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑔̅̅ ̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑐̅𝑜̅̅𝑚̅̅𝑒̅;̅𝑜̅𝑡̅ℎ̅̅𝑒̅𝑟̅̅ ̅𝑜̅𝑝̅̅𝑒̅𝑟̅̅𝑎̅̅𝑡̅𝑖̅𝑛̅𝑔̅̅ ̅𝑒̅𝑥̅̅𝑝̅̅𝑒̅𝑛̅̅𝑠̅𝑒̅]\n+𝑀𝑎𝑥 [̅𝐹̅𝑒̅̅𝑒̅ ̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑐̅𝑜̅̅𝑚̅̅𝑒̅;̅𝑓̅𝑒̅̅𝑒̅ ̅𝑒̅𝑥̅̅𝑝̅̅𝑒̅𝑛̅̅𝑠̅𝑒̅]\n𝐹𝐶 =𝐴̅̅𝑏̅̅𝑠̅̅(̅𝑛̅̅𝑒̅𝑡̅ ̅𝑃̅̅&̅̅𝐿̅̅ 𝑡̅̅𝑟̅𝑎̅̅𝑑̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑔̅̅ ̅𝑏̅𝑜̅̅𝑜̅̅𝑘̅)̅+𝐴̅̅𝑏̅̅𝑠̅̅(̅𝑛̅̅𝑒̅𝑡̅ ̅𝑃̅̅&̅̅𝐿̅̅ 𝑏̅̅𝑎̅̅𝑛̅𝑘̅̅𝑖̅𝑛̅̅𝑔̅̅ 𝑏̅̅𝑜̅̅𝑜̅𝑘̅).\nGuidance—meaning of business indicator terms\nP&L or Description Typical sub-items\nbalance-\nsheet items\nProfit, ijarah rental and dividend component\nProfit income Profit income from all • Profit income from all financings,\nfinancings, financial assets available for sale, assets\nassets and other profit held to maturity, trading assets,\nincome (includes profit ijarah rentals\nincome from ijarah • Profit income from Shari’a-\ncontracts) compliant hedge accounting\n• Other profit income, not included\nin the categories above\n• Profits from leased assets\nProfit Profit payments on all • expenses or returns payable on\npayment to financial liabilities and funds received from investment\nfund other return payments account holders, current account\nproviders (includes rentals payable deposits, debt securities issued,\non ijarah losses, ijarah contracts\ndepreciation and\nimpairment of ijarah\nassets)\nProfit- Total gross outstanding financings, sukuk, other profit-bearing\nearning financial assets (including sovereign sukuk), and Ijarah assets\nassets measured at the end of each financial year\n(balance\nsheet item)\nDividend Dividend income from investments in stocks and funds not\nincome consolidated in the firm’s financial statements, including dividend\nincome from non-consolidated subsidiaries, associates and joint\nventures\npage 368 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nOperational risk capital requirement Part 7.4\nRule 7.4.5\nP&L or Description Typical sub-items\nbalance-\nsheet items\nServices component\nFee and Income received from Fee and commission income from:\ncommission providing advice and • securities (issuance, origination,\nincome services.

The firm’s BIC\nis the sum of the amounts calculated by multiplying:\n(a) the part of the firm’s BI up to and including QR 4 billion by\n12%;\n(b) any part of the BI over QR 4 billion but not over QR 120\nbillion by 15%; and\npage 370 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nOperational risk capital requirement Part 7.4\nRule 7.4.7\n(c) any part of the BI over QR 120 billion by 18%.\nGuidance\nThe marginal coefficients increase with the size of the BI. For firms with a BI less\nthan or equal to QR 4 bn, the BIC is equal to BI × 12%. For a BI of QR 165 bn, the\nBIC would be (4 x 12%) + ((120 - 4) x 15%) + ((165 - 120) x 18%) = QR 25.98 bn.\n7.4.7 Calculation of internal loss multiplier\n(1) An Islamic banking business form’s internal loss multiplier (ILM) is\nintended to take into account the firm’s operational risk experience in\ncalculating the firm’s operational risk capital requirement.\n(2) The firm’s ILM is calculated by the formula:\n𝐿𝐶 0.8\n𝐼𝐿𝑀 = ln(exp(1)− 1+( ) )\n𝐵𝐼𝐶\nwhere LC (the loss component) is equal to 15 times the firm’s average\nannual losses incurred over the previous 10 years as a result of\noperational risk events.\nGuidance\nThe ILM is equal to 1 if the firm’s loss component and business indicator\ncomponent are equal. If the LC is greater than the BIC, the ILM is greater than 1.\nThat is, a firm with losses that are high relative to its BIC is required to hold more\ncapital. Conversely, if the LC is lower than the BIC, the ILM is less than 1 and the\nfirm is required to hold less capital.\n(3) If the firm holds 10 years of high-quality annual loss data, collected\nas set out in Part 7.3, the calculation of average losses for subrule (2)\nmust be based on that 10 years of data. If the firm does not have\n10 years of high-quality annual loss data, but has 5 years of such data,\nit may use the 5 years of data.\n7.4.8 Calculation of operational risk capital requirement\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s operational risk capital\nrequirement is the product of the firm’s BIC and its ILM.\n(2) However:\n(a) if an Islamic banking business firm’s loss data does not meet the\nstandards set out in Part 7.3 for the whole of the previous 5-year\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 371\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nPart 7.4 Operational risk capital requirement\nRule 7.4.9\nperiod, the firm’s operational risk capital requirement is equal\nto its BIC; and\n(b) the Regulatory Authority may direct the firm to apply an ILM\ngreater than 1.\n7.4.9 Approval of exclusion of certain losses from dataset\nThe Regulatory Authority may approve the exclusion, by an Islamic\nbanking business firm, of an operational loss event, or a class of\noperational loss events, from the firm’s operational loss dataset if the\nAuthority is satisfied that the event, or events of that class, are no\nlonger relevant to the firm’s risk profile.\nGuidance\nApproval to exclude internal loss events will be granted rarely and an application\nto do so must be supported by strong justification. In evaluating the relevance of an\noperational loss event to the firm’s risk profile, the Authority will consider whether\nthe cause of the event could occur in other areas of the firm’s operations. Taking\nsettled legal exposures and divested activities as examples, the Authority will\nexpect the firm to demonstrate that there is no similar or residual legal exposure\nand that the event to be excluded has no relevance to other continuing activities or\nproducts.\nThe Authority will approve such an exclusion only if satisfied that the loss to be\nexcluded is material to the firm’s operations (for example, that the relevant loss is\ngreater than 5% of the firm’s average losses).\nThe Authority will approve the exclusion of a loss event (except for losses related\nto divested activities) only after it has been included in the firm’s operational loss\ndataset for a minimum period (for example, 3 years).\nDivision 7.4.C Additional powers of Regulatory\nAuthority\n7.4.10 Powers of Regulatory Authority in relation to operational\nrisk capital requirement\nDespite anything in Division 7.4.B, if the Regulatory Authority\nidentifies points of exposure or vulnerability to operational risk that\npage 372 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nOperational risk capital requirement Part 7.4\nRule 7.4.10\nare common to 2 or more Islamic banking business firms, it may\nimpose specific capital requirements or limits on each affected firm.\nExamples\n• outsourcing of important operations by many Islamic banking business\nfirms to a single provider\n• severe disruption to providers of payment and settlement services.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 373\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nPart 7.5 Guidance on operational risks relating to Islamic financial contracts\nRule 7.5.1\nPart 7.5 Guidance on operational risks\nrelating to Islamic financial\ncontracts\n7.5.1 Introduction\n(1) This Part gives guiidance on the Shari’a requirements in relation to\nIslamic financial contracts and on the operational risks that may arise\nfrom them.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm’s failure to comply with the\nrequirements, or any lack of precision in contract documentation, can\ngive rise to Shari’a non-compliance risk.\nNote The section is taken from IFSB-15: Revised Capital Adequacy Standard\nfor Institutions Offering Islamic Financial Services, but the requirements\nmay vary depending of the views of different Shari’a supervisory boards.\nUnder FSR, article 17 (4), guidance is indicative of the view of the\nRegulatory Authority at the time and in the circumstances in which it was\ngiven.\n7.5.2 Requirements for murabahah and ijarah contracts\n(1) The asset is in existence at the time of sale or lease or, in the case of\nijarah, the lease contract is preceded by acquisition of the usufruct of\nthat asset (except if the asset was agreed upon based on a general\nspecification).\n(2) The asset is in the legal and constructive possession of the Islamic\nbanking business firm when it is offered for sale or lease.\n(3) The asset is intended to be used by the buyer or lessee for activities\nor businesses permissible by Shari’a. If the asset is leased back to its\nowner in the first lease period, it does not lead to a contract of ’inah.\nNote An ’inah (also called bay ’inah or bay-al inah) is a double sale by which\nthe borrower and the lender sell and then resell an asset between them,\nonce for cash and once for a higher price whose payment is deferred. The\nnet result is a loan with interest and, as such, is prohibited by the majority\nof Shari’a scholars.\npage 374 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nGuidance on operational risks relating to Islamic financial contracts Part 7.5\nRule 7.5.3\n(4) There is no late payment penalty fee or increase in price in exchange\nfor extending or rescheduling the date of payment of accounts\nreceivable or lease receivable, irrespective of whether the obligor is\nsolvent or insolvent.\n7.5.3 Requirements for salam and istisna contracts\n(1) Sale and purchase contracts cannot be interdependent and\ninterconditional on each other (such as salam and parallel salam, or\nistisna and parallel istisna).\n(2) The is no penalty clause for delay in the delivery of a commodity that\nis purchased under a salam contract. However, such a penalty clause\nis allowed under istisna and parallel istisna.\nNote An essential characteristic of a salam or istisna contract is that the subject\nmatter does not, and is not required to, exist physically when the parties\nenter into the contract.\n7.5.4 Requirements for mudarabah and musharakah contracts\n(1) The capital of the Islamic banking business firm should be invested\nin Shari’a-compliant investments or business activities.\n(2) A partner in musharakah cannot guarantee the capital of another\npartner, nor may the mudarib guarantee the capital of the mudarabah.\n(3) The purchase price of another partner’s share in a musharakah with a\nbinding promise to purchase can only be set at market value or\naccording to an agreement entered into at the time the contract\nbecame binding. However, the agreement should not stipulate that the\nshare be purchased at its nominal value based on the capital originally\ncontributed.\n7.5.5 Operational risks—murabahah\n(1) At the time the murabahah contract becomes binding, it is required\nthat an Islamic banking business firm has purchased the asset and had\nit in its legal or constructive possession before selling it to the\ncustomer. Therefore, the firm should ensure that the legal\ncharacteristics of the contract properly match the commercial intent\nof the transactions.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 375\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nPart 7.5 Guidance on operational risks relating to Islamic financial contracts\nRule 7.5.6\n(2) If the mudarabah customer acts as the agent of the firm for purchasing\nthe asset, title to the asset should first pass to the firm and not directly\nto the customer.\n7.5.6 Operational risks—salam\n(1) This section sets out some of the operational risks that may arise when\nan Islamic banking business firm purchases from a customer, under a\nsalam contract, goods against advanced payment.\n(2) If the underlying goods delivered are of an inferior quality to that\nspecified in the contract, the Islamic banking business firm (as buyer)\nshould:\n(a) reject the goods; or\n(b) accept them at the originally agreed price.\nIn the latter case, the firm may suffer loss if it sells the goods at a\nlower price than would have been obtained for those specified in the\ncontract.\nNote In case of a parallel salam, however, the buyer of the commodity from\nthe Islamic banking business firm may (but is not obliged to) agree to\naccept the goods at the contract price. In such a case, the firm does not\nsuffer any loss of profit.\n(3) The underlying goods may be delivered by the customer before the\nagreed date. If the goods delivered meet the contract specifications,\nthe Islamic banking business firm (as buyer):\n(a) normally has to accept the goods before the agreed delivery date;\nand\n(b) may incur additional costs for storage, takaful cover and\ndeterioration (if the goods are perishable) before the goods are\nresold.\n(4) The salam contract may include a provision for restitution to be made\nto the firm for any loss suffered under subsection (2) or costs incurred\nunder subsection (3).\npage 376 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nGuidance on operational risks relating to Islamic financial contracts Part 7.5\nRule 7.5.7\n(5) The firm may face legal risk if the goods in a parallel salam cannot\nbe delivered to the parallel salam buyer because of:\n(a) late delivery by the salam seller (the customer); or\n(b) delay by the firm itself.\nFor legal risk not to arise in such a case, the parallel salam buyer will\nhave to agree to change the delivery date of the goods.\n7.5.7 Operational risks—istisna\n(1) In the case of istisna with parallel istisna, an Islamic banking business\nfirm contracts to deliver a constructed or manufactured asset and\nenters into a contract with a subcontractor to construct or manufacture\nthe asset.\n(2) The reliance of the firm on the subcontractor can expose it to various\noperational risks such as those set out in subsections (3) to (6). These\nrisks need to be managed by a combination of:\n(a) legal precautions;\n(b) due diligence in choosing subcontractors; and\n(c) selection of suitably qualified consultants and staff to carry out\nthe contract with the subcontractor and, ultimately, deliver the\nconstructed or manufactured asset to the customer.\n(3) In case of late delivery by the subcontractor, the firm may be unable\nto deliver the asset to the ultimate counterparty on the agreed date,\nand can, therefore, be subject to penalties for late delivery.\n(4) In case of cost overruns during the construction or manufacturing\nprocess (because of increases in the prices of raw materials, increases\nin manufacturing or production costs or delays by the subcontractor),\nadditional costs may have to be absorbed wholly or partly by the firm,\nin the absence of an agreement in advance with the ultimate\ncounterparty.\n(5) If the subcontractor fails to meet quality standards or other\nspecifications agreed with the ultimate counterparty, the firm may\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 377\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nPart 7.5 Guidance on operational risks relating to Islamic financial contracts\nRule 7.5.8\nface legal risk if no agreement is reached with the subcontractor and\nthe ultimate counterparty:\n(a) for remedying the defects; or\n(b) for reducing the contract price.\n(6) If the subcontractor fails to complete the asset on time, the firm may\nhave to find a replacement from the market and can, therefore, be\nsubject to additional costs.\n7.5.8 Operational risks—ijarah and IMB contracts\n(1) In an ijarah or IMB contract, an Islamic banking business firm (as\nlessor) may face, during the period of lease, the operational risks set\nout in this section.\n(2) The ultimate use of the ijarah asset should be Shari’a-compliant.\nOtherwise, the firm will be exposed to non-recognition of the ijarah\nincome as non-permissible, and the firm will be required to repossess\nthe asset and find a new lessee.\n(3) If the lessee damages the asset in its possession and refuses to pay for\nthe damage, the firm will have to repossess the asset and take legal\naction to cover damages. This might involve operational and\nlitigation costs.\n(4) If the asset is severely damaged or destroyed without the fault of the\nlessee, the firm (as lessor) is required to provide a replacement to the\nlessee. If the asset is not insured, the firm will have to bear the cost\nof buying the new asset.\n(5) Further, if the firm fails to provide the lessee with a replacement, the\nlessee may terminate the ijarah contract without paying the rentals\nfor the remaining period.\n(6) If the asset is damaged without the fault of the lessee, but can still be\nused, the firm (as lessor) is required to decrease the amount of the\nrentals. The decrease should be proportionate to the decrease in the\nutility of the asset.\npage 378 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nGuidance on operational risks relating to Islamic financial contracts Part 7.5\nRule 7.5.9\n(7) In the event of default or misconduct by the lessee, the firm may face\nlegal risk in relation to the enforcement of its contractual right to\nrepossess the asset.\n7.5.9 Operational risks—musharakah\n(1) In a musharakah contract, an Islamic banking business firm provides\nfinancing on the basis of a profit-sharing and loss-sharing contract.\n(2) The firm may fail to carry out adequate due diligence on the customer\nor the financed venture.\n(3) During the period of the investment, the firm may fail to monitor the\nventure’s financial performance adequately or may not receive the\nrequired information from the customer.\n7.5.10 Operational risks—mudarabah\n(1) In a mudarabah contract, an Islamic banking business firm provides\nfinancing on the basis of a profit-sharing and loss-bearing contract.\n(2) The firm’s customer (as mudarib) is not required to bear any losses,\nin the absence of negligence, misconduct, fraud or breach of contract\non its part. The customer is required to act in a fiduciary capacity as\nthe manager of the firm’s funds.\n(3) The absence of the firm’s right to control the management of the\nenterprise as capital provider (rabb al-mal) may give rise to\noperational risk.\n(4) The customer may fail to provide the firm with regular, adequate and\nreliable information about the financial performance of the venture.\n(5) The firm may fail to carry out adequate due diligence on the customer\nor the financed venture.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 379\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.1\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\n7A.1.1 Introduction\nThe leverage ratio is a simple, transparent, non-risk-based measure to\nhelp restrict the build-up of leverage in the banking system. Excessive\nleverage can expose banking businesses to higher financial risk, with\npotential damage to the overall financial system, and to the economy\nif a de-leveraging process takes place.\n7A.1.2 Objectives of leverage ratio requirements\nThe leverage ratio supplements the risk-based capital requirements of\nthese Rules. The objectives of limiting banking business firms’\nleverage ratios are as follows:\n(a) to constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, to\nhelp avoid destabilising deleveraging that can damage the\nbroader financial system and the economy;\n(b) to reinforce the risk-based requirements in Chapter 3 with a\nsimple, non-risk-based backstop measure;\n(c) to serve as a broad measure of the sources of leverage, both on\nand off the balance-sheet.\n7A.1.3 How to calculate leverage ratio\nAn Islamic banking business firm’s leverage ratio LR is calculated by\nmeans of the following formula:\n𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑟 1 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙\nLR = × 100\n𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒\nwhere:\ntier 1 capital has the meaning given by rule 3.2.7 (2).\ntotal exposure measure is the total amount of all the firm’s exposures,\ncalculated in accordance with rule 7A.1.5.\npage 380 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.4\n7A.1.4 Minimum leverage ratio\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must maintain a leverage ratio of\nat least 3%.\n(2) The Regulatory Authority may direct an Islamic banking business\nfirm to maintain a leverage ratio higher than 3% if the Authority\nconsiders it necessary to do so because of the firm’s risk profile or\nother particular circumstances.\n7A.1.5 How to calculate total exposure measure — general\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s total exposure measure is the\nsum of:\n(a) on-balance-sheet exposures (except on-balance-sheet SCHI\nexposures and SFT exposures) (see rule 7A.1.7);\n(b) its SCHI exposures (see rules 7A.1.11 to 7A.1.16);\n(c) its SFT exposures (see rules 7A.1.17 and 7A.1.18); and\n(d) its off-balance-sheet exposures (see rule 7A.1.19).\nGuidance\nSFT exposures are exposures from securities financing transactions such as\nrepurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and\nborrowing, and margin lending contracts, where the value of the contracts depends\non the market valuation of securities and the contracts are typically subject to\nmargin agreements.\n(2) When an Islamic banking business firm is calculating its total\nexposure measure, it must follow the accounting standard that the\nfirm normally uses, except that:\n(a) on-balance-sheet, non-SCHI exposures must be included net of\nspecific provisions or accounting valuation adjustments;\n(b) except as specified otherwise in this Part, the firm must not take\naccount of physical or financial collateral, guarantees or other\ncredit risk mitigation techniques; and\n(c) financings and deposits must not be netted.\nNote For the permitted accounting standards, see rule 2.1.6.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 381\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.6\n7A.1.6 Modification of calculation\n(1) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice, modify the\ncalculation of an Islamic banking business firm’s total exposure\nmeasure by, for example:\n(a) allowing the firm not to take account of a particular exposure or\nclass of exposures;\n(b) directing the firm to apply a different risk weight to an exposure\nor class of exposures;\n(c) directing the firm to take account of an exposure or class of\nexposures that would not otherwise be taken account of.\n(2) The Authority may give a notice under subrule (1) on the application\nof the firm or on the Authority’s own initiative.\n7A.1.7 How to calculate on-balance-sheet exposures\n(1) When an Islamic banking business firm calculates its total exposure\nmeasure, it must include all on-balance-sheet items on the assets side\nof its balance-sheet, including the collateral of SCHI contracts and\nsecurities financing contracts.\n(2) On-balance-sheet non-SCHI assets must be measured using their\nbalance-sheet (that is, unweighted) values less deductions for\nassociated provisions.\n(3) If the firm holds an asset in a fiduciary capacity, it may exclude the\nasset if the asset meets the accounting criteria for de-recognition and,\nif applicable, the accounting criteria for deconsolidation.\n(4) Items that are deducted completely from the firm’s tier 1 capital (such\nas goodwill) must also be deducted from its total exposure measure.\n(5) The amount of an investment in the capital of an unconsolidated\nfinancial entity that is wholly or partly deducted from the firm’s\nCET 1 or additional tier 1 capital under Division 3.2.D must be\ndeducted from the firm’s total exposure measure. An unconsolidated\nfinancial entity is a financial entity (that is, an entity involved in\nbanking or other financial activity, or insurance) that is not included\nin the firm’s consolidated returns.\npage 382 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.8\n(6) Liability items must not be deducted from the firm’s total exposure\nmeasure.\n7A.1.8 Effect of trade-date accounting\n(1) In calculating its on-balance-sheet exposures, an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm that uses trade-date accounting must reverse out any\noffsetting that is recognised under the applicable accounting standard\nbetween cash receivables for unsettled sales and cash payables for\nunsettled purchases.\n(2) The firm may offset between those receivables and payables\n(regardless of whether the offsetting is recognised under the\napplicable accounting standard) if the following conditions are met:\n(a) the assets bought and sold that are associated with the payables\nand receivables are fair valued through income and are included\nin the firm’s trading book;\n(b) the contracts are settled on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP)\nbasis.\n7A.1.9 Effect of settlement-date accounting\nAn Islamic banking business firm that uses settlement-date\naccounting must calculate its on-balance-sheet exposures as set out in\nrule 7A.1.7.\n7A.1.10 Treatment of cash pooling arrangements\n(1) For the purpose of calculating an Islamic banking business firm’s on-\nbalance-sheet exposures, if the firm operates a cash pooling\narrangement that entails a transfer at least daily of the balances of\neach participating customer’s account into a single balance, the\ncustomers’ account balances are taken to be transformed into a single\nbalance on the transfer if, after the transfer, the firm is not liable for\nthe balances individually.\nGuidance\nThus, the basis of the leverage ratio exposure is the single account balance and not\nthose of the individual customer accounts.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 383\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.10\n(2) If the transfer does not occur daily, a transformation into a single\naccount balance is taken to occur, and the single account balance may\nbe taken as the basis of the exposure measure, if all of the following\nconditions are met:\n(a) as well as providing for the individual customers’ accounts, the\narrangement provides for a single account into which of all the\nparticipating customers’ account balances can be transferred;\n(b) the firm:\n(i) has a legally enforceable right to transfer each\nparticipating customer’s account balance into a single\naccount so that the bank is not liable for the balances\nindividually, and\n(ii) at any time, the firm has the discretion and is able to do so;\n(c) the Regulatory Authority considers that the customers’ account\nbalances are transferred to a single account sufficiently often;\n(d) either:\n(i) there are no maturity mismatches among the customers’\naccounts; or\n(ii) all of those accounts are either overnight or on demand;\n(e) the firm pays interest and charges fees based on the combined\nbalance of the customers’ accounts that are covered by the\narrangement.\n(3) If the conditions in subrule (2) are not met, the firm’s leverage ratio\nexposure measure must be based on the individual balances of the\nparticipating customer accounts.\npage 384 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.11\n7A.1.11 Calculation of SCHI exposure — contracts covered by\neligible bilateral netting agreements\nFor SCHI contracts covered by an eligible bilateral netting agreement,\nan Islamic banking business firm must calculate its SCHI exposure as\nset out in rules 4.6A.12 and 4.6A.13.\nNote In relation to how eligible netting agreements are to be applied for the\npurposes of this Division, see Subdivision 4.6.E.1.\n7A.1.12 Calculation of SCHI exposure — single SCHI contracts\nnot covered by eligible bilateral netting agreement\nAn Islamic banking business firm must calculate its exposure for a\nsingle SCHI transaction that is not covered by an eligible bilateral\nnetting agreement as the credit equivalent amount of the transaction,\nas set out in rule 4.6A.9 (2).\n7A.1.13 Cross-product netting not permitted\nCross-product netting (that is, netting between SCHI and securities\nfinancing contracts) is not permitted. If an Islamic banking business\nfirm is a party to a cross-product netting agreement that otherwise\nmeets the criteria for an eligible bilateral netting agreement, the firm\nmay perform netting separately in each product category if all the\nother conditions for netting in the category are met.\n7A.1.14 Treatment of written credit SCHIs\n(1) The effective notional amount for a written credit SCHI that is\nleveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the contract is\nobtained by adjusting the notional amount of the contract in\naccordance with this rule, to reflect the true exposure that results from\nthe leverage or enhancement.\n(2) The effective notional amount may be reduced in either or both of the\nfollowing ways:\n(a) by the negative change in fair value amount that has been\nincorporated into the calculation of tier 1 capital in relation to\nthe SCHI;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 385\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.14\n(b) by the effective notional amount of an offsetting purchased\ncredit SCHI on the same reference entity, if the conditions set\nout in subrule (3) are satisfied.\n(3) The conditions for subrule (2) (b) are the following:\n(a) the written and the offsetting SCHIs refer to the same legal\nentity;\n(b) the remaining maturity of the offsetting SCHIs is equal to or\ngreater than the remaining maturity of the written SCHIs;\n(c) for single-name credit SCHIs:\n(i) the credit protection purchased is on a reference obligation\nthat ranks equally with, or is junior to, the reference\nobligation of the written SCHIs; and\n(ii) a credit event on the senior reference asset would result in\na credit event on the subordinated reference asset;\n(d) for tranched products, the purchased protection is on a reference\nobligation with the same level of seniority;\n(e) if the firm purchases protection on a pool of reference names,\nthe protection is economically equivalent to buying protection\nseparately on each individual name in the pool, and the pool of\nreference entities and the level of subordination in both contracts\nare identical.\n(4) When the effective notional amount is included in the exposure as\ndescribed in subrule (2), and a deduction of offsetting purchased\ncredit SCHIs is made (see subrule (2) (b)), the effective notional\namount of the offsetting credit protection must also be reduced by any\nresulting positive change in the firm’s tier 1 capital.\n(5) When the effective notional amount is included in the exposure as\ndescribed in subrule (2), but no deduction of offsetting purchased\ncredit SCHIs is made (see subrule (2) (b)):\n(a) if an eligible bilateral netting agreement applies, the firm may\ndeduct the individual PFE add-on amount from PFE ; or\ngross\npage 386 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.15\n(b) if no such netting agreement applies, the firm may set PFE for\nrule 4.6A.9 (as applied by rule 7A.1.12) to 0.\n(6) However, no adjustments may be made to NGR.\n7A.1.15 Treatment of collateral\n(1) When an Islamic banking business firm is calculating its SCHI\nexposures, the firm must not deduct collateral that it has received\nfrom counterparties.\n(2) The firm must gross up its exposures by the amount of any collateral\nprovided by the firm if the provision of the collateral has reduced the\nvalue of the firm’s balance-sheet assets under the relevant accounting\nstandard.\n7A.1.16 Treatment of cash variation margin\n(1) If all of the following conditions are met, an Islamic banking business\nfirm may treat the cash portion of variation margin exchanged\nbetween counterparties as a form of pre-settlement payment:\n(a) either of the following is true:\n(i) the trades are cleared through a qualifying central\ncounterparty;\nNote For the meaning of qualifying central counterparty, see the\nGlossary.\n(ii) the cash received by the counterparty is not segregated;\n(b) the variation margin is calculated and exchanged every day,\nbased on mark-to-market valuation of SCHI positions;\n(c) the variation margin is received in the same currency as the\ncurrency of settlement of the relevant SCHI contract;\n(d) the variation margin exchanged is the full amount that would be\nnecessary to fully extinguish the mark-to-market exposure of the\nSCHI, subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts\napplicable to the counterparty;\n(e) SCHI contracts and variation margins are covered by a single\nmaster netting agreement (MNA) between the counterparties;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 387\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.17\n(f) the MNA explicitly stipulates that the counterparties agree to\nsettle net any payment obligations covered by it, taking into\naccount any variation margin received or provided if a credit\nevent occurs involving either counterparty;\n(g) the MNA is legally enforceable and effective in all the relevant\njurisdictions, including in the event of default, bankruptcy or\ninsolvency.\n(2) If the conditions in subrule (1) are met, the firm may use the cash\nportion of the variation margin received to reduce the replacement\ncost portion (as set out in rule 4.6A.9 (2)) of the exposure, and may\ndeduct the resulting receivables assets from the exposure, as follows:\n(a) if the firm receives cash variation margin from a counterparty,\nit may reduce only the replacement cost portion of the exposure\namount of the SCHI asset by the amount of cash received if the\npositive mark-to-market value of the SCHI contract or contracts\nhas not already been reduced by that amount;\n(b) if the firm provides cash variation margin to a counterparty, it\nmay deduct the resulting receivable from its exposure, if the\ncash variation margin has been recognised as an asset.\n7A.1.17 SFT exposures—firm acting as principal\n(1) When an Islamic banking business firm is acting as a principal in a\nsecurities financing contract, its total exposure measure must include\nthe sum of:\n(a) its gross SFT assets as recognised for accounting purposes,\nadjusted in accordance with subrule (2); and\n(b) a measure of exposure to counterparty credit risk (CCR),\ncalculated in accordance with subrule (3).\n(2) The firm’s gross SFT assets as recognised for accounting purposes\nare adjusted as follows:\n(a) by excluding the value of any securities, received under a\nsecurities financing contract, that the firm has recognised as an\nasset on its balance-sheet;\npage 388 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.17\n(b) cash payables and cash receivables in securities financing\ncontracts with the same counterparty may be measured net if all\nthe following criteria are met:\n(i) the contracts have the same explicit final settlement date;\n(ii) the right to set off the amount owed to the counterparty\nagainst the amount owed by it is legally enforceable both\ncurrently in the normal course of business and in the event\nof default, insolvency or bankruptcy;\n(iii) either:\n(A) the firm and the counterparty intend to settle net or\nsettle simultaneously; or\n(B) the contracts are subject to a settlement mechanism\nthat results in the functional equivalent of net\nsettlement (that is, the cash flows of the contracts are\nequivalent to a single net amount on the settlement\ndate).\nGuidance\nTo achieve that equivalence, both contracts are settled through the\nsame settlement system and the settlement arrangements are supported\nby cash or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that settlement\nof both contracts will occur by the end of the business day, and the\nlinkages to collateral flows do not result in the unwinding of net cash\nsettlement. The failure of any one contract in the settlement\nmechanism should delay settlement of only the matching cash leg or\ncreate an obligation to the settlement mechanism, supported by an\nassociated credit facility.\n(3) The measure of exposure to CCR is calculated as follows:\n(a) for exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement,\nthe current exposure is:\nmax {(∑E - ∑C), 0};\ni i\nwhere:\n∑E is the total fair value of securities and cash lent to the\ni\ncounterparty for all contracts covered by the agreement.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 389\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 7 Operational risk\nChapter 7A Leverage ratio\nRule 7A.1.17\n∑C is the total fair value of cash and securities received from\ni\nthe counterparty for those contracts;\n(b) if there is no qualifying master netting agreement, the current\nexposure for contracts with a counterparty must be calculated\ncontract by contract.\n(4) A bilateral netting agreement is a qualifying master netting\nagreement for subrule (3) (a) only if:\n(a) it is legally enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction on an event\nof default, regardless of whether the counterparty is insolvent or\nbankrupt;\n(b) it provides the non-defaulting party with the right to terminate\nand close out, in a timely way, all contracts under the agreement\non an event of default, including the insolvency or bankruptcy\nof the counterparty;\n(c) it provides for the netting of gains and losses on contracts\n(including the value of any collateral) terminated and closed out\nunder it so that a single net amount is owed by one party to the\nother; and\n(d) it allows for the prompt monetisation or setoff of collateral on\nan event of default.\n(5) Positions held in the firm’s banking book may be netted against\npositions held in its trading book only if both of the following\nconditions are satisfied:\n(a) all the contracts are marked to market daily;\n(b) any collateral is recognised as eligible collateral in the banking\nbook.\nNote For the meaning of eligible collateral, see the Glossary and\nrule 4.6.12.\n(6) For a securities financing contract that is treated, under the relevant\naccounting standard, as a sale, the firm must reverse all the sales-\nrelated accounting entries, and then calculate its exposure as if the\npage 390 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nOperational risk Chapter 7\nLeverage ratio Chapter 7A\nRule 7A.1.18\ncontract had been treated as a financing contract under subrules (1) to\n(3) for the purposes of determining its SFT exposures.\n7A.1.18 SFT exposures—firm acting as agent\n(1) If an Islamic banking business firm that is acting as an agent in a\nsecurities financing contract provides an indemnity or guarantee to a\ncustomer or counterparty for any difference between the value of the\nsecurity or cash that the customer has lent and the value of the\ncollateral that the borrower has provided, the firm must calculate its\nexposure in accordance with rule 7A.1.17 (3).\n(2) The firm may apply the treatment in subrule (1) only if:\n(a) the firm’s exposure to the contract is limited to the guaranteed\ndifference between the value of the security or cash that its\ncustomer has lent and the value of the collateral that the\nborrower has provided;

and\n(c) to have adequate sources of stable long-term funding.\n(2) In general terms, this Chapter requires an Islamic banking business\nfirm:\n(a) to have a risk management framework to measure, monitor and\nmanage liquidity risk that is appropriate for the nature, scale and\ncomplexity of the firm’s operations;\n(b) to maintain a portfolio of high-quality liquid assets sufficient to\nenable the firm to withstand a severe liquidity stress;\n(c) to maintain a robust funding structure appropriate for the nature,\nscale and complexity of the firm’s operations;\n(d) to limit maturity mismatches between its assets and its\nliabilities; and\n(e) to inform the Regulatory Authority promptly about liquidity\nconcerns.\n8.1.2 Categorisation of firms in terms of liquidity management\nobligations\n(1) For the purposes of this Chapter, Islamic banking business firms are\neither liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business firms or\nliquidity risk group B Islamic banking business firms.\npage 396 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity risk management—introductory Part 8.1\nRule 8.1.3\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm is a liquidity risk group A Islamic\nbanking business firm if it has been so designated by the Regulatory\nAuthority. Any other Islamic banking business firm is a liquidity\ngroup B banking business firm.\n8.1.3 Designation of firms as liquidity risk group A Islamic\nbanking business firms\n(1) The Authority may designate an Islamic banking business firm as a\nliquidity risk group A Islamic banking business firm by written notice\nif the Authority is satisfied that:\n(a) the firm meets any of the criteria in subrule (2); or\n(b) it is necessary to do so for any other reason.\n(2) The criteria are the following:\n(a) the firm is active internationally;\n(b) it is significant to the general stability and effective working of\nthe financial system;\n(c) there is significant liquidity risk associated with it;\n(d) it is systemically linked to another liquidity risk group A Islamic\nbanking business firm or a liquidity risk group A banking\nbusiness firm;\n(e) it (first firm) is so connected to another liquidity risk group A\nIslamic banking business firm (second firm) that, if the first firm\nwere not a liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business firm,\nthe connection would or might adversely affect either or both of\nthe following:\n(i) the second firm’s calculation of its LCR;\n(ii) the first firm’s calculation of its MLR.\nNote For LCR, see rule 8.4.1; for MLR, see rule 8.5.2.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 397\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.1 Liquidity risk management—introductory\nRule 8.1.4\n8.1.4 Application of Chapter 8\nThe Parts of this Chapter apply to Islamic banking business firms as\nset out in table 8.1.4.\nTable 8.1.4 Application of Parts of Chapter 8\nPart Applies to:\nPart 8.1 All Islamic banking business firms\nPart 8.2 All Islamic banking business firms\nPart 8.3 All Islamic banking business firms\nPart 8.4 Liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business\nfirms\nPart 8.5 Liquidity risk group B Islamic banking business\nfirms\nPart 8.6 Liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business\nfirms\nPart 8.7 Liquidity risk group B Islamic banking business\nfirms\nPart 8.8 All Islamic banking business firms\nPart 8.9 All Islamic banking business firms\nDivision 8.1.B Principles\n8.1.5 Principle 1—sound management of liquidity risk\nAn Islamic banking business firm is responsible for the sound\nmanagement of its liquidity risk, and must have a robust framework\nto manage that risk.\n8.1.6 Principle 2—maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet\nobligations as they fall due\nAn Islamic banking business firm must at all times maintain sufficient\nliquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due, and must hold a\npage 398 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity risk management—introductory Part 8.1\nRule 8.1.7\nminimum level of high-quality liquid assets to survive a severe\nliquidity stress.\n8.1.7 Principle 3—stable sources of funding\nAn Islamic banking business firm must ensure that its activities are\nfunded with stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis.\n8.1.8 Principle 4—informing the Regulatory Authority of\nliquidity concerns\nAn Islamic banking business firm must inform the Regulatory\nAuthority as soon as possible of any concerns that the firm has about\nits current or future liquidity, and its plans to address these concerns.\nIn particular, if an Islamic banking business firm experiences a severe\nliquidity stress, it must notify the Authority immediately, and must\ndescribe the action that is being taken to address the situation.\nGuidance\nIndividual rules in this Chapter that require the Authority to be notified\n“immediately” specify what is meant by “immediately”.\n8.1.9 Responsibilities of governing body and senior\nmanagement\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s governing body is ultimately\nresponsible for the sound and prudent management of the firm’s\nliquidity risk. An Islamic banking business firm must maintain a\nliquidity risk management framework that is appropriate for the level\nand extent of liquidity risk to which the firm is exposed.\n(2) The governing body must ensure that:\n(a) the firm’s senior management and other relevant personnel have\nthe necessary experience to manage liquidity risk; and\n(b) the firm’s liquidity risk management framework and liquidity\nrisk management practices are documented, and are reviewed at\nleast annually.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 399\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.1 Liquidity risk management—introductory\nRule 8.1.9\n(3) The governing body must review regular reports on the firm’s\nliquidity and, as necessary, information on new or emerging liquidity\nrisks.\n(4) An Islamic banking business firm’s senior management must do all\nof the following:\n(a) develop a liquidity management strategy, policies and processes\nin accordance with the liquidity risk appetite approved by the\nfirm’s governing body;\nNote For liquidity risk appetite, see rule 8.3.1.\n(b) ensure that the firm maintains sufficient liquidity at all times;\n(c) determine the structure, responsibilities and controls for\nmanaging liquidity risk, and for overseeing the liquidity\npositions, of the firm and all of its branches and subsidiaries in\nall of the jurisdictions in which the firm and its branches and\nsubsidiaries are active, and set out that structure and those\nresponsibilities and controls clearly in the firm’s liquidity\npolicies;\n(d) ensure that the firm has adequate internal controls to ensure the\nintegrity of its liquidity risk management processes;\n(e) ensure that stress tests, contingency funding plans and holdings\nof high-quality liquid assets are effective and appropriate for the\nfirm;\n(f) establish reporting criteria specifying the scope, manner and\nfrequency of reporting for various recipients (such as the firm’s\ngoverning body and senior management and any relevant\ncommittee of the governing body) and fix who is responsible for\npreparing the reports;\n(g) establish the specific procedures and approvals necessary for\nmaking exceptions to policies and limits, including the\nescalation procedures and follow-up actions to be taken for\nbreaches of limits;\npage 400 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity risk management—introductory Part 8.1\nRule 8.1.9\n(h) closely monitor current trends and potential market\ndevelopments that may present challenges for managing\nliquidity risk, so that appropriate and timely changes to the\nliquidity management strategy can be made as needed;\n(i) continuously review information on the firm’s liquidity\ndevelopments and report to the governing body regularly.\n(5) The firm’s governing body and senior management must be able to\ndemonstrate a thorough understanding of:\n(a) the links between funding liquidity risk (the risk that the firm\nmay not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due)\nand market liquidity risk (the risk that liquidity in financial\nmarkets, such as the market for debt securities, may decline\nsignificantly); and\n(b) how risks of other kinds, such as credit risk, market risk,\noperational risk and reputational risk, affect the firm’s liquidity\nrisk management strategy.\nGuidance\n1 An Islamic banking business firm needs a robust Shari’a governance system\nto ensure that there is effective independent oversight of Shari’a compliance\nwithin the firm. One of the major parts of that system is the firm’s Shari’a\nsupervisory board. Members of the board should take an active role in issues\nof compliance with Shari’a that the firm faces in managing liquidity risk.\n2 IFSB–10 (Guiding Principles on Shari’ah governance systems for institutions\noffering Islamic financial services, published by the Islamic Financial Services\nBoard in December 2009, highlights the role of an Islamic banking business\nfirm’s Shari’a supervisory board in the firm’s Shari’a governance processes.\nSome areas related to liquidity risk management where the board can play an\nimportant role include:\n• approving new Shari’a-compliant liquidity risk management products\nand mechanisms, including Shari’a-compliant hedging products\n• ensuring that the firm’s products and mechanisms are properly executed,\nin association with the firm’s internal Shari’a compliance and audit\nfunctions\n• controlling and verifying the non-commingling of funds between Islamic\nsubsidiaries and parent conventional entities\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 401\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.1 Liquidity risk management—introductory\nRule 8.1.10\n• controlling and verifying the extent of the firm’s investments with\nconventional financial institutions.\n3 For more on the Shari’a supervisory board and its responsibilities, see CTRL,\nPart 9.3.\n8.1.10 Relation to internal capital adequacy assessment\nAn Islamic banking business firm must be able to demonstrate to the\nRegulatory Authority that its ICAAP adequately captures liquidity\nrisk, even if the effect of liquidity risk on the firm’s capital is indirect\n(for example, by reducing the value of the firm’s assets at the time\nthey are realised).\nNote For ICAAP, see rule 3.1.5.\npage 402 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nGuidance on liquidity risks arising from Islamic financial contracts Part 8.2\nRule 8.2.1\nPart 8.2 Guidance on liquidity risks\narising from Islamic financial\ncontracts\nNote for Part 8.2\nThis Part applies to all Islamic banking business firms—see rule 8.1.4.\n8.2.1 Introduction\nThis Part gives guidance on the liquidity risks that may arise from\nvarious Islamic financial contracts. An Islamic banking business firm\nshould look into risk transformation in these contracts during their\nvarious stages, because such transformations may directly or\nindirectly affect the liquidity of the contracts.\nNote Under FSR, article 17 (4), guidance is indicative of the view of the\nRegulatory Authority at the time and in the circumstances in which it was\ngiven.\n8.2.2 Liquidity risks—murabahah\nIn a murabahah contract, an Islamic banking business firm’s liquidity\nmay be affected by late payment or non-payment by the customer.\n8.2.3 Liquidity risks—commodity murabahah\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm may offer commodity murabahah\naccounts as a means of raising funds. Because raising funds in this\nway requires the firm to pay back the principal and agreed share of\nprofit to the customer on maturity, the firm may be exposed to\nliquidity risk.\n(2) If commodity-murabahah-based funds (which are usually short-term\nin nature) are used by the firm to finance longer-term assets, a\nmaturity mismatch will result. Such a mismatch may become acute if\nthe firm has a high reliance on such deposits to fund its assets.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 403\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.2 Guidance on liquidity risks arising from Islamic financial contracts\nRule 8.2.4\n8.2.4 Liquidity risks—salam\nIn a salam contract, the illiquidity of commodity markets and the non-\npermissibility of exiting the contract before delivery can give rise to\nliquidity risk for an Islamic banking business firm.\n8.2.5 Liquidity risks—ijarah\nIn an ijarah contract, an Islamic banking business firm may be\nexposed to liquidity risk because of:\n(a) late payment or non-payment of instalments by the customer;\n(b) the inability to sell or lease the asset to a new customer at the\nend of an earlier contract; or\n(c) default by the customer.\n8.2.6 Liquidity risks—mudarabah and musharakah\nIn a mudarabah or musharakah contract, an Islamic banking business\nfirm may be exposed to liquidity risk because of:\n(a) late payment or non-payment of profit payments during the\ncontract; or\n(b) non-payment by the customer of the remaining principal at the\nend of the contract.\n8.2.7 Liquidity risks—PSIAs\nAn Islamic banking business firm may be affected by panic\nwithdrawals of funds by IAHs. Such withdrawals may result from rate\nof return risk, Shari’a non-compliance risk or reputational risk.\n8.2.8 Liquidity risks—qard\nAn Islamic banking business firm may offer unremunerated current\naccounts on the basis of qard, under which the firm guarantees the\nnominal amount of the accounts. The firm should pay back the full\namount on demand and should therefore ensure that sufficient funds\nare available to do so as and when the demand arises.\npage 404 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity risk management—firms’ obligations in detail Part 8.3\nRule 8.3.1\nPart 8.3 Liquidity risk management—\nfirms’ obligations in detail\nNote for Part 8.3\nThis Part applies to all Islamic banking business firms—see rule 8.1.4.\n8.3.1 Liquidity risk appetite\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s liquidity risk appetite defines the\nlevel of liquidity risk that the firm is willing to assume.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm’s liquidity risk appetite must be\nappropriate for the firm’s operations and strategy and its role in the\nfinancial systems in which it operates.\n(3) The firm must review its liquidity risk appetite at least annually to\nreflect the firm’s financial condition and funding capacity.\n(4) The firm’s governing body and senior management must ensure that\nthe firm’s liquidity risk appetite and tolerance allows the firm to\neffectively manage its liquidity in such a way that the firm can\nwithstand prolonged liquidity stress.\n(5) The firm must document its liquidity risk appetite in a way that clearly\nstates the trade-off between risks and profits.\n8.3.2 Liquidity risk management framework—structure and\nbasic content\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s liquidity risk management\nframework must include:\n(a) a statement of the firm’s liquidity risk appetite, approved by the\nfirm’s governing body;\n(b) a statement of the firm’s liquidity risk management strategy and\npolicy, approved by the governing body;\n(c) a statement of the firm’s operating standards (in the form of\npolicies, procedures and controls) for identifying, measuring,\nmonitoring and controlling its liquidity risk in accordance with\nits liquidity risk appetite and tolerance;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 405\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.3 Liquidity risk management—firms’ obligations in detail\nRule 8.3.3\n(d) a statement of the firm’s funding strategy, approved by the\ngoverning body; and\n(e) a contingency funding plan.\n(2) The framework must clearly set out the firm’s organisational structure\nas it relates to liquidity risk management, and must define the\nresponsibilities and roles of senior management involved in\nmanaging liquidity risk.\n(3) The framework must be formulated to ensure that the firm maintains\nsufficient liquidity to withstand a range of liquidity stress events\n(whether specific to the firm, market-wide, or a combination of the\ntwo), including the loss or impairment of both unsecured and secured\nfunding sources.\n(4) The framework must be well integrated into the firm’s overall risk\nmanagement process.\n(5) The liquidity risk management framework must be subject to ongoing\neffective and comprehensive independent review.\nGuidance\nIn most cases, the independent reviews could be facilitated by the firm’s internal\naudit function but may require the engagement of independent experts outside that\nfunction.\n8.3.3 Liquidity risk management—oversight\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s liquidity risk management\noversight function must be operationally independent. It must be\nstaffed with personnel who have the skills and authority to challenge\nthe firm’s treasury and other liquidity management functions.\n(2) The firm must have adequate policies, procedures and controls to\nensure that the firm’s governing body and senior management are\ninformed immediately of new and emerging liquidity concerns.\nGuidance\nThose concerns could include:\n• increasing funding costs or concentrations\n• increases in funding requirements\npage 406 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity risk management—firms’ obligations in detail Part 8.3\nRule 8.3.4\n• shortage of other sources of liquidity\n• material or persistent breaches of limits\n• significant decline in the firm’s holdings of unencumbered liquid\nassets\n• changes in market conditions that could signal future difficulties.\n(3) The firm’s senior management must be satisfied that all of the firm’s\nbusiness units whose activities affect the firm’s liquidity:\n(a) are fully aware of the firm’s liquidity risk management strategy;\nand\n(b) operate in accordance with the firm’s approved policies,\nprocedures, limits and controls.\n8.3.4 Liquidity management strategy\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s liquidity management strategy\nmust include specific policies on liquidity management, such as:\n(a) the composition and maturity of assets and liabilities;\n(b) the diversity and stability of funding sources;\n(c) the firm’s approach to managing liquidity in different\ncurrencies, across borders, and across business lines and legal\nentities; and\n(d) the firm’s approach to intraday liquidity management.\n(2) The strategy must take account of the firm’s liquidity needs both\nunder normal conditions and during periods of liquidity stress. The\nstrategy must include quantitative and qualitative targets.\n(3) The strategy must be appropriate for the nature, scale and complexity\nof the firm’s operations. In formulating the strategy, the firm must\nconsider its legal structure, its key business lines, the breadth and\ndiversity of its markets and products, the jurisdictions in which it\noperates, and regulatory requirements.\n(4) The firm’s senior management must communicate the following\nthroughout the firm:\n(a) the strategy;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 407\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.3 Liquidity risk management—firms’ obligations in detail\nRule 8.3.5\n(b) the firm’s key policies for implementing it;\n(c) the firm’s liquidity management structure.\n8.3.5 Liquidity risk management—processes\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must have a sound process for\nidentifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. The\nprocess must include a robust framework for comprehensively\nprojecting cashflows arising from assets, liabilities and off-balance-\nsheet items over an appropriate set of time horizons.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm must set limits to control its\nliquidity risk exposure and vulnerabilities. The limits and the\ncorresponding escalation procedures must be reviewed regularly.\n(3) The limits must be relevant to the business in terms of its location,\nthe complexity of its operations, the nature of its products, and the\ncurrencies and markets it serves. If a limit is breached, the firm must\nimplement a plan of action to review the exposure and reduce it to a\nlevel that is within the limit.\n(4) An Islamic banking business firm must actively manage its collateral\npositions, distinguishing between encumbered and unencumbered\nassets. The firm must monitor the legal entity in which, and the\nphysical location where, collateral is held and how collateral can be\nmobilised in a timely manner.\n(5) An Islamic banking business firm must design a set of early warning\nindicators to help its daily liquidity risk management processes to\nidentify the emergence of increased risk or vulnerabilities in its\nliquidity risk position or potential funding needs. The indicators must\nbe structured so as to help identify negative trends in the firm’s\nliquidity position and to lead to an assessment and a potential\nresponse by management to mitigate the firm’s exposure to the trends.\n(6) An Islamic banking business firm must have a reliable management\ninformation system that provides the governing body, senior\nmanagement and other appropriate personnel with timely and\nforward-looking information on the firm’s liquidity position.\npage 408 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity risk management—firms’ obligations in detail Part 8.3\nRule 8.3.6\n(7) An Islamic banking business firm must actively manage its intraday\nliquidity positions to meet payment and settlement obligations on a\ntimely basis under both normal and stressed market conditions, thus\ncontributing to the orderly functioning of payment and settlement\nsystems.\n(8) An Islamic banking business firm must develop and implement a\ncosts and benefits allocation process for funding and liquidity. The\nprocess must appropriately apportion the costs of prudent liquidity\nmanagement to the sources of liquidity risk, and must provide\nappropriate incentives to manage liquidity risk.\n(9) An Islamic banking business firm that is active in multiple currencies:\n(a) must assess its aggregate foreign currency liquidity needs and\ndetermine an acceptable level of currency mismatches; and\n(b) must undertake a separate analysis of its strategy for each\nsignificant currency, considering possible constraints during\nperiods of liquidity stress.\nNote Such a firm must also maintain a portfolio of high-quality liquid assets\nconsistent with the distribution of its liquidity needs by currency—see\nrule 8.4.6 (3).\n(10) For subrule (9) (b), a currency is significant for an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm if the firm’s liabilities denominated in it amount to 5%\nor more of the firm’s total liabilities.\n8.3.6 Funding strategy\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm:\n(a) must develop and document a 3-yearly funding strategy;\n(b) must maintain a continuing presence in its chosen funding\nmarkets;\n(c) must maintain strong relationships with funds providers; and\n(d) must regularly estimate its capacity to raise funds quickly.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 409\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.3 Liquidity risk management—firms’ obligations in detail\nRule 8.3.7\n(2) The firm must identify the main factors that affect its ability to raise\nfunds, and must monitor those factors closely to ensure that its\nestimates of its fund-raising capacity remain valid.\n(3) The strategy must be approved by the firm’s governing body, and\nmust be supported by robust assumptions in line with the firm’s\nliquidity management strategy and business objectives.\n(4) The funding strategy must be reviewed at least annually, and must be\nupdated as necessary in light of changed funding conditions or\nchanges in the firm’s business model.\n(5) The firm must give a copy of the funding strategy to the Regulatory\nAuthority on request. The firm must also inform the Authority of any\nsignificant change to the strategy.\n8.3.7 Stress testing\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must carry out stress tests regularly\nfor a variety of short-term and long-term liquidity stress scenarios\n(firm-specific and market-wide, separately and in combination) to\nidentify sources of potential liquidity stress and to ensure that the\nfirm’s exposures continue to be in accordance with its liquidity risk\nappetite and tolerance.\n(2) The tests must enable the firm to analyse the effect of stress scenarios\non its liquidity positions, and on the liquidity positions of individual\nbusiness lines.\n(3) The scenarios and related assumptions must take into account the\nparticular features specific to Islamic financial business.\nGuidance\nFor guidance on those features and how they should be taken into account, see\nIFSB–13, Guiding principles on stress testing for institutions offering Islamic\nfinancial services [excluding Islamic insurance (takaful) institutions and Islamic\ncollective investment schemes], published by the Islamic Financial Services Board\nin March 2012.\n(4) The test scenarios and related assumptions must be well documented,\nand must be reviewed together with the test results. The results, the\nvulnerabilities found and any resulting actions must be reported to,\npage 410 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity risk management—firms’ obligations in detail Part 8.3\nRule 8.3.8\nand discussed with, the firm’s governing body and the Regulatory\nAuthority.\n(5) The test outcomes must be used to adjust the firm’s liquidity\nmanagement strategy, policies and positions, and to develop effective\ncontingency plans to deal with liquidity stress.\n(6) The results of the tests must be integrated into the firm’s strategic\nplanning process and its day-to-day risk management practices. The\nresults must be explicitly considered in the setting of internal limits.\n(7) The firm must decide how to incorporate the results in assessing and\nplanning for possible funding shortfalls in its contingency funding\nplan.\n8.3.8 Contingency funding plan\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must have a formal contingency\nfunding plan that clearly sets out the firm’s strategies for addressing\nliquidity shortfalls in emergency situations. The plan:\n(a) must outline policies to manage a range of liquidity stress\nsituations;\n(b) must establish clear lines of responsibility; and\n(c) must include clear escalation procedures.\n(2) The plan must be appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of\nthe firm’s operations and the firm’s role in the financial systems in\nwhich it operates.\n(3) The plan must provide a framework with a high degree of flexibility\nso that the firm can respond quickly in a variety of liquidity stress\nsituations.\n(4) The plan must set out:\n(a) available sources of contingency funding and an estimate of the\namount of funds that can be obtained from each source;\n(b) clear procedures for escalation and prioritisation, setting out\nwhen and how each of the actions in the plan can and must be\nactivated; and\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 411\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.3 Liquidity risk management—firms’ obligations in detail\nRule 8.3.8\n(c) the lead time needed to obtain additional funds from each of the\nsources.\n(5) The plan’s design, scope and procedures must be closely integrated\nwith the firm’s continuing analysis of liquidity risk and with the\nassumptions used in its stress tests and the results of those tests. The\nplan must address issues over a range of different time horizons,\nincluding intraday.\n(6) The firm must review and test the plan regularly to ensure that the\nplan remains effective and operationally feasible. The firm must\nreview and update the plan for the governing body’s approval at least\nannually (or more often, as changing business or market\ncircumstances require).\npage 412 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.4\nfirms\nRule 8.4.1\nPart 8.4 Liquidity coverage ratio—\nliquidity risk group A Islamic\nbanking business firms\nNotes for Part 8.4\n1 Much of this Part is based on:\n• Basel III: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and risk monitoring tools,\npublished in January 2013 by the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision, available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs238.htm (Basel\nIII LCR)\n• Guiding Principles on Liquidity Risk Management for Institutions\nOffering Islamic Financial Services [Excluding Islamic Insurance\n(Takaful) Institutions and Islamic Collective Investment Schemes],\npublished by the Islamic Financial Services Board in March 2012\n(IFSB-12)\n• Guidance Note on Quantitative Measures for Liquidity Management in\nInstitutions Offering Islamic Financial Services [Excluding Islamic\nInsurance (Takaful) Institutions and Islamic Collective Investment\nSchemes], published by the Islamic Financial Services Board in April\n2015 (IFSB GN 6).\n2 This Part applies only to liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business\nfirms—see rule 8.1.4.\nDivision 8.4.A Introductory\n8.4.1 Introduction—Part 8.4\n(1) This Part requires a liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business\nfirm to maintain a portfolio of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA\nportfolio) that can be monetised to meet the firm’s liquidity needs for\n30 calendar days under severe liquidity stress. This Part sets out:\n(a) what assets qualify as high-quality liquid assets;\n(b) how much the portfolio must be able to raise if monetised;\n(c) how assets must be valued for inclusion in the portfolio; and\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 413\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.4 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking\nbusiness firms\nRule 8.4.2\n(d) how much of the portfolio’s value may be made up of assets of\ndifferent kinds.\nGuidance\nTo obtain liquidity, a firm could monetise an asset by, for example, sale or repo.\n(2) This Part also requires an Islamic banking business firm to maintain\na specified ratio (liquidity coverage ratio or LCR) of HQLA to its\npredicted need for liquidity over a 30-calendar-day period.\n(3) The purpose of requiring Islamic banking business firms to maintain\nthe HQLA portfolio, and to meet the LCR requirement, is to ensure\nthat such firms are resilient, in the short term, to liquidity risk. The\nLCR requirement is intended to ensure that such a firm always holds\nunencumbered assets that can be readily converted into sufficient\ncash to meet the firm’s liquidity needs for 30 calendar days even\nunder severe liquidity stress.\n(4) An Islamic banking business firm is required to maintain its HQLA\nportfolio, and to meet the minimum LCR, at all times. Therefore, such\na firm should frequently calculate:\n(a) its liquidity needs for the coming 30 calendar days; and\n(b) the value of its HQLA portfolio.\n(5) Nothing in this Part prevents an Islamic banking business firm from\nholding HQLA in excess of the amounts required by this Part.\n8.4.2 Application of Part 8.4\n(1) This Part applies to an Islamic banking business firm on a solo basis.\nNote For the application of this Part to a firm that is a branch (and the global\nliquidity concession), see rule 8.4.58.\n(2) However, if an Islamic banking business firm is a member of a\nfinancial group that is subject to consolidated supervision by the\nRegulatory Authority, the Authority may direct the financial group as\na whole to comply with this Part.\nNote For the application of this Part to a financial group, see rule 8.4.5.\npage 414 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.4\nfirms\nRule 8.4.3\n8.4.3 Definitions for Part 8.4\nIn this Part:\nfinancial institution includes an Islamic banking business firm and\nan authorised firm of any other kind, and any of the following kinds\nof entity established outside the QFC:\n(a) a bank;\n(b) a securities firm;\n(c) an insurance company;\n(d) a fiduciary (that is, a legal entity that is authorised to manage\nassets on behalf of a third party, including an asset-management\nentity such as a pension fund or collective investment vehicle);\n(e) a beneficiary (that is, a legal entity that receives, or may become\neligible to receive, benefits under a will, insurance policy,\nretirement plan, annuity, trust, or other contract).\nhigh-quality liquid assets has the meaning given by rules 8.4.8\nto 8.4.13.\nHQLA means high-quality liquid assets.\nLCR means liquidity coverage ratio.\nliquidity coverage ratio for an Islamic banking business firm means\nthe ratio calculated in accordance with rule 8.4.20.\n8.4.4 References in Part 8.4 to encumbered and unencumbered\nassets\n(1) For this Part:\nunencumbered, in relation to an asset, means free of legal,\nregulatory, contractual or other restrictions on liquidation, sale,\ntransfer, or assignment.\n(2) For this Part, an asset is encumbered if it is lodged (either explicitly\nor implicitly) to secure, collateralise or credit-enhance a transaction,\nor is designated to cover operational costs (such as rents and salaries).\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 415\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.4 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking\nbusiness firms\nRule 8.4.5\n(3) However, assets received by an Islamic banking business firm in\nreverse-repo and securities financing transactions are taken to be\nunencumbered if the assets:\n(a) are held at the firm;\n(b) have not been re-hypothecated; and\n(c) are legally and contractually available for the firm’s use.\n(4) In addition, assets that have been pre-positioned or deposited with, or\nlodged with, a central bank or a public sector entity may be treated as\nunencumbered if the assets:\n(a) otherwise qualify as HQLA; and\n(b) have not been used to generate liquidity.\n8.4.5 Application of LCR to financial group\n(1) For calculating a consolidated LCR for a financial group, HQLA held\nto meet liquidity needs at the firm level may be included in the\nconsolidated parent entity’s HQLA portfolio only so far as the related\nliabilities are also reflected in the parent entity’s LCR. Any surplus\nof HQLA held at the firm may be treated as forming part of the parent\nentity’s HQLA portfolio only if those assets would be freely available\nto the parent entity during a period of liquidity stress.\n(2) When calculating its LCR on a consolidated basis, a cross-border\nbanking group must, subject to subrule (3), apply its home\njurisdiction’s rules to all the legal entities that are being consolidated.\n(3) The firm must treat deposits by retail and small business customers\nwith a consolidated entity according to the rules in the jurisdiction in\nwhich that entity operates. The firm must also apply those rules to\ndecide whether a particular deposit qualifies as a deposit by a retail\ncustomer or a small business customer.\n(4) A cross-border banking group must not take excess liquidity into\naccount in calculating its consolidated LCR if there is reasonable\npage 416 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.4\nfirms\nRule 8.4.6\ndoubt about whether the liquidity would be available during a period\nof liquidity stress.\nGuidance\nLiquidity transfer restrictions (for example, ring-fencing measures, non-\nconvertibility of local currency, and foreign exchange controls) in jurisdictions in\nwhich an Islamic banking group operates would affect the availability of liquidity\nby restricting the transfer of HQLA and funds flows within the group. The\nconsolidated LCR should reflect the restrictions consistently with this Part. For\nexample, HQLA held to meet a local LCR requirement by a subsidiary that is being\nconsolidated can be included in the consolidated LCR to the extent that the HQLA\nare used to cover the total net cash outflows of that subsidiary, even if the assets are\nsubject to restrictions on transfer to the parent entity. If the HQLA held in excess\nof the total net cash outflows are not transferable, the firm should not count that\nsurplus liquidity.\nDivision 8.4.B HQLA portfolio—makeup and value\n8.4.6 Requirement for HQLA portfolio—basic rules\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must maintain an HQLA portfolio\nsufficient to meet its funding needs for at least 30 calendar days under\nsevere liquidity stress.\nNote The value of the HQLA portfolio must bear a minimum ratio to the firm’s\noutflows over the 30-calendar-day period. That minimum ratio is the\nliquidity coverage ratio or LCR—see rules 8.4.16 and 8.4.20.\n(2) The assets in the portfolio must be appropriately diversified in terms\nof type, issuer, currency and counterparty.\n(3) The firm must be able to meet its liquidity needs in each currency in\nwhich it has significant exposure. The portfolio must be similar in\ncomposition (in terms of the currencies in which the assets are\ndenominated) to its liquidity needs.\n(4) For subrule (3), an Islamic banking business firm has significant\nexposure in a currency if 5% or more of the firm’s total liabilities are\ndenominated in the currency.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 417\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.4 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking\nbusiness firms\nRule 8.4.7\n8.4.7 HQLA portfolio—general operational requirements\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s HQLA portfolio must be under\nthe control of the specific function or functions charged with\nmanaging the firm’s liquidity. That function must always have the\nauthority, and must always be legally and operationally able, to\nmonetise any asset in the portfolio.\nGuidance\nFor the firm to be operationally able to monetise assets, the firm must have the\nnecessary procedures and appropriate systems, and must have access to all the\nnecessary information. The function must actually be able to monetise any of the\nassets within the standard settlement period for the asset class.\n(2) That control must be shown by:\n(a) maintaining the portfolio in a separate pool managed by the\nfunction solely as a source of contingent funds; or\n(b) showing that the function can monetise any asset in the portfolio\nat any time, and that the proceeds of doing so are available to\nthe function throughout the following 30-calendar-day period,\nconsistently with the firm’s business and risk-management\nstrategies.\n(3) The firm must monetise a representative part of the portfolio\nperiodically (at least annually):\n(a) to test the firm’s access to the market, the effectiveness of its\nprocesses for liquidation and the availability of the assets; and\n(b) to minimise the risk of giving a negative signal during a period\nof actual liquidity stress.\n8.4.8 What assets are HQLA\n(1) An asset is HQLA if it falls within any of rules 8.4.10 to 8.4.12, or is\napproved by the Regulatory Authority as HQLA under rule 8.4.13.\nGuidance\nAssets that fall within any of rules 8.4.10 to 8.4.12 are HQLA because such assets\ncan be monetised easily and immediately with little or no loss of value.\npage 418 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.4\nfirms\nRule 8.4.9\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm must not include an asset in its\nHQLA portfolio if the asset is encumbered.\nNote For the meaning of encumbered, see rule 8.4.4 (2).\n(3) The firm must not include an asset in the portfolio if the firm could\nnot, for any operational, legal, regulatory or other reason, monetise it\nat any time and receive the proceeds within 30 calendar days.\nGuidance\n1 For example, the firm should not include an asset if:\n• the asset was hypothecated to the firm and the asset’s beneficial owner\nhas the right to withdraw it\n• the sale of the asset without replacement would remove a hedge so as to\ncreate an open risk position in excess of the firm’s internal risk limit.\n2 When considering whether to include a particular asset, a firm should take into\naccount any possible delays in the settlement of a sale.\n3 Subrule (3) would not prevent assets received as collateral for Shari’a-\ncompliant hedging transactions from being included in the portfolio provided\nthat:\n• the assets are not segregated and are legally able to be re-hypothecated\n• the firm records an appropriate outflow for the associated risks.\n8.4.9 Classification of HQLA\n(1) HQLA are classified as either level 1 HQLA or level 2 HQLA.\nLevel 1 HQLA are the highest-quality, most liquid assets, and level 2\nHQLA are other high-quality liquid assets.\n(2) Level 2 HQLA are further classified as either level 2A HQLA or\nlevel 2B HQLA.\nGuidance\nAll classes of HQLA (other than cash and Central Bank reserves) are Shari’a-\ncompliant marketable securities that are traded in large, deep and active repo or\ncash markets with a low level of concentration.\n8.4.10 Level 1 HQLA\nLevel 1 HQLA consists of:\n(a)

How often the firm\nneeds to calculate its LCR depends on the nature of the firm’s business.

It may allow its LCR to fall below\nthe level required by rule 8.4.16 to the extent necessary to deal with\ncash outflows during that period.\n8.4.19 Obligation to notify Regulatory Authority if LCR\nrequirement not met\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must notify the Regulatory\nAuthority in writing immediately (but within 3 business days) if the\npage 426 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.4\nfirms\nRule 8.4.20\nfirm ceases to meet its LCR requirement (or becomes aware of\ncircumstances that may result in its ceasing to meet that requirement).\n(2) In the notification the firm must clearly explain:\n(a) why it ceased to meet, or thinks it may cease to meet, the\nrequirement;\n(b) when it expects to again be able to meet the requirement; and\n(c) what it has done, and will do, to ensure that it meets the\nrequirement in future, or continues to meet it, as the case\nrequires.\nGuidance\nAn Islamic banking business firm that gives such a notification should discuss with\nthe Regulatory Authority what further steps it should take to deal with the situation.\nSubdivision 8.4.C.2 Calculating LCR\n8.4.20 How to calculate LCR\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s LCR is calculated by means of\nthe following formula:\n𝑉𝑃\n𝐿𝐶𝑅 = ×100\n𝑇𝐶30\nwhere:\nTC30 is the firm’s total net cash outflow over the next 30 calendar\ndays (all outflows, or outflows in the relevant currency, as the case\nrequires), calculated in accordance with rule 8.4.21.\nVP is the total value of the assets in the firm’s HQLA portfolio,\ncalculated in accordance with rule 8.4.15.\nNote For calculating the value of the portfolio, the market value of an asset in\nthe portfolio is taken to be the asset’s market value, subject to a haircut—\nsee rule 8.4.15.\n(2) The firm must calculate its LCR both overall, and separately for each\nsignificant currency in which it has liabilities.

Those rules are based on Basel III\nLCR, IFSB–12 and IFSB GN 6. The interpretive provisions provide only\nminimal explanation of the reasons why particular kinds of outflow\nreceive the runoff rates specified. For a fuller explanation, consult Basel\nIII LCR (in particular, paragraphs 69–141), IFSB–12 and IFSB GN 6.\n(2) For that calculation, if profit is payable on the outstanding balance of\na liability or off-balance-sheet commitment, any profit that is\nexpected to be paid during the relevant period must be added to the\nbalance.\nSubdivision 8.4.C.4 Calculating total expected gross cash\noutflows—runoff rates for retail deposits,\nwholesale unsecured funding and\nsecured funding\n8.4.23 Treatment of retail deposits generally\n(1) The runoff rates for retail deposits generally are as set out in\ntable 8.4.23.\n(2) However, this rule does not apply to:\n(a) a PSIA (whether restricted or unrestricted) (see rule 8.4.24);\n(b) a deposit or PSIA that falls within rule 8.4.26; or\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 429\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.4 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking\nbusiness firms\nRule 8.4.23\n(c) unsecured wholesale funding that falls within rule 8.4.27.\nNote Rule 8.4.25 allows the Regulatory Authority to direct that a higher runoff\nrate must be applied to deposits or PSIAs that would otherwise fall within\nrule 8.4.23 or 8.4.24 but have unusual features.\n(3) In the case of a deposit or PSIA that is pledged as security for a\nfinancing facility, this rule is subject to rule 8.4.28.\nTable 8.4.23 Retail deposits—runoff rates\nKind of deposit Runoff rate\n(%)\nRetail demand deposits (other than CMT-based\ndeposits), and term deposits with maturity of\n30 calendar days or less:\n• stable deposits (see subrule (4)) covered by a 3\nShari’a-compliant deposit insurance scheme\nthat meets all of the additional criteria in\nsubrule (7)\n• other stable deposits 5\n• less stable deposits (see subrules (8), (9)) 10\nCMT-based deposits from retail and small 20\nbusiness customers\nNote 1 CMT-based deposits from non-financial corporates, sovereigns, central\nbanks, MDBs and public sector entities are treated as unsecured\nwholesale funding—see rule 8.4.27 (16).\nNote 2 CMT-based deposits create particular liquidity risks:\n“In such transactions, the customer first buys a commodity and sells it\nto [an Islamic banking business firm] on a deferred payment basis at an\nagreed price with a profit margin.

If CMT-based funds, which are usually short-term in\nnature, are used by the [firm] to finance longer-term assets, a maturity-\nmismatch will result. Such a mismatch may become acute if [the firm]\npage 430 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.4\nfirms\nRule 8.4.23\nhas a high reliance on such deposits to fund its assets.” (IFSB–12,\nparagraph 51).\nFor the meaning of IFSB–12, see the note at the beginning of Part 8.4.\n(4) Stable deposits are deposits that are fully insured (see subrule (5)) (or\nare covered by a public guarantee that provides equivalent\nprotection), and for which either of the following is true:\n(a) the depositor has other established relationships with the firm\nthat make withdrawal highly unlikely;\n(b) the deposit is in a transactional account (for example, an account\ninto which the depositor’s salary is automatically deposited).\n(5) A deposit is fully insured if 100% of the deposit amount, up to the\napplicable deposit insurance limit, is covered by an effective (see\nsubrule (6)) Shari’a-compliant deposit insurance scheme. Deposit\nbalances up to the limit are treated as fully insured even if the\ndepositor’s balance is over the limit. However, any amount over the\nlimit is to be treated as a less stable deposit.\nGuidance\nFor example, if a depositor has a deposit of 150 that is covered by a deposit\ninsurance scheme that has a limit of 100, so that the depositor would receive at least\n100 from the scheme if the firm were unable to pay, then 100 would be considered\nfully insured and treated as a stable deposit, and 50 would be treated as a less stable\ndeposit. However, if the scheme covered only a percentage of the deposit amount\n(for example, 90% of the deposit amount up to a limit of 100), the entire 150 deposit\nwould be treated as a less stable deposit.\n(6) A Shari’a-compliant deposit insurance scheme is effective if all of the\nfollowing are true:\n(a) the scheme guarantees that it can make payouts promptly;\n(b) its coverage is clearly defined;\n(c) the provider has formal legal powers to fulfil the scheme’s\nmandate, and is operationally independent, transparent and\naccountable;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 431\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.4 Liquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking\nbusiness firms\nRule 8.4.23\n(d) public awareness of the scheme is high.\nGuidance\nFor Shari’a-compliant deposit insurance, see IFSB–12 paragraph 162, and\nIFSB GN 6, section 2.3.1.2, para 57.\n(7) The additional criteria (for a Shari’a-compliant deposit insurance\nscheme) mentioned in table 8.4.23 are the following:\n(a) the scheme is pre-funded by periodic levies on entities with\ninsured deposits;\n(b) the scheme has ready access to additional funding in the event\nof a large call on its reserves (for example, an explicit and legally\nbinding guarantee from its government, or a standing authority\nto borrow from its government);\n(c) depositors have access to insured deposits quickly if the scheme\nis called on.\n(8) A deposit that does not fall within subrule (4) is a less stable deposit.\n(9) If the firm cannot readily identify a term deposit as stable, it must\ntreat the full amount of the deposit as less stable.\n(10) The firm may exclude, from total expected cash outflows, the cash\noutflow related to a term deposit with residual maturity, or a notice\nperiod for withdrawal, longer than 30 calendar days only if:\n(a) the depositor has no legal right to withdraw the deposit within\nthe 30-calendar-day period; or\n(b) early withdrawal would result in a significant reduction of profit\nthat is materially greater than the loss of profit for the period.\n(11) However, if the practice of the firm is to allow depositors to withdraw\nsuch deposits within the 30-calendar-day period without imposing the\ncorresponding reduction of profit, each such deposit must be treated\nin full as a demand deposit unless the Regulatory Authority approves\notherwise.\npage 432 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.4\nfirms\nRule 8.4.24\n8.4.24 Treatment of maturing PSIAs\n(1) The runoff rates for PSIAs that mature with the relevant 30-calendar-\nday period are as set out in table 8.4.24.\nTable 8.4.24 Maturing PSIAs—runoff rates\nItem Kind of PSIA Runoff\nrate (%)\n1 Restricted PSIAs:\n• stable (covered by a Shari’a-compliant 3\ndeposit insurance scheme that meets\nall of the additional criteria in\nrule 8.4.23 (7))\n• other stable (according to the criteria 5\nin rule 8.4.23 (4))\n• less stable 10\n2 Unrestricted PSIAs:\n• stable (covered by a Shari’a-compliant 3\ndeposit insurance scheme that meets\nall of the additional criteria\nin rule 8.4.23 (7))\n• other stable (according to the criteria 5\nin rule 8.4.23 (4))\n• less stable 10\n(2) If a firm cannot readily identify a PSIA as stable in accordance with\nthe criteria in rule 8.4.23 (4), it must treat the full amount of the PSIA\nas less stable.

Such services are limited to the following activities:\n• transmission, reconciliation and confirmation of payment orders\n• daylight overdraft, overnight financing and maintenance of post-\nsettlement balances\n• determination of intra-day and final settlement positions.\n2 Custody is the provision of safekeeping, reporting and processing of assets, or\nthe facilitation of the operational and administrative elements of related\nactivities on behalf of customers in the process of their transacting and\nretaining financial assets. Such services are limited to the settlement of\nsecurities transactions, the transfer of contractual payments, the processing of\ncollateral, and the provision of custody-related cash management services.\n3 Custody also includes the receipt of dividends and other income and client\nsubscriptions and redemptions, and extends to asset and corporate trust\nservicing, treasury, escrow, funds transfer, stock transfer and agency services,\n(including payment and settlement services, but not correspondent banking),\nand depository receipts.\n4 Cash management is the provision of cash management and related services\nto customers—that is, services provided to a customer to manage its cash\nflows, assets and liabilities, and conduct financial transactions necessary to its\noperations. Such services are limited to payment remittance, collection and\naggregation of funds, payroll administration, and control over the\ndisbursement of funds.\n5 Correspondent banking is an arrangement under which a bank holds deposits\nowned by other banks, and provides payment and other services to settle\nforeign currency transactions.\n(7) The firm may treat a deposit as an operational deposit only if the\ndeposit meets all of the following requirements:\n(a) it is a by-product of the underlying services provided by the\nfirm;\n(b) it is not offered by the firm in the wholesale market for the sole\npurpose of offering profit income;\npage 438 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nLiquidity coverage ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.4\nfirms\nRule 8.4.27\n(c) it is held in a specifically-designated account;\n(d) it is priced so as not to give customers an economic incentive to\nleave excess funds in the account.\n(8) Excess balances that could be withdrawn without jeopardising those\nclearing, custody or cash management activities are not to be treated\nas operational deposits.\n(9) The firm must determine how to identify such excess balances. If the\nfirm is unable to identify how much of a deposit is an excess balance,\nthe firm must assume that the entire deposit is excess and therefore\nnot operational.\nGuidance\nThe identification should be sufficiently granular to adequately assess the risk of\nwithdrawal in an idiosyncratic stress situation. The method should take into account\nrelevant factors such as the likelihood that wholesale customers have above-average\nbalances in advance of specific payment needs, and should consider appropriate\nindicators (for example, ratios of account balances to payment or settlement\nvolumes or to assets under custody) to identify customers that are not actively\nmanaging account balances efficiently.\n(10) A deposit that arises out of correspondent banking, or from the\nprovision of prime brokerage services, is not to be treated as an\noperational deposit.\nGuidance\nPrime brokerage services is a package of services offered to large active investors,\nparticularly institutional hedge funds.

Those rules are based\non Basel III LCR, IFSB–12 and IFSB GN 6. The interpretive provisions\ninclude only minimal explanation of why a particular kind of inflow\nreceives the rate specified. For a fuller explanation, consult Basel III LCR\n(in particular, paragraphs 142–160), IFSB–12 and IFSB GN 6.\nGuidance\nAn inflow rate does not represent an assumption about the risk of a default—\ninstead, it represents the likelihood that the relevant obligation will be rolled over\n(so that the firm does not actually receive the cash) or that no cash will be received\nfor some other reason. (The possibility of default is excluded by rule 8.4.43 (2) (a),\nwhich allows only inflows from performing exposures to be included.) Inflows for\nwhich an inflow rate of 0% is specified are effectively treated as not being\nreceivable.\n(2) When an Islamic banking business firm is calculating its cash\ninflows:\n(a) it may include a contractual inflow from an exposure only if the\nexposure is classified under rule 4.3.3 as performing, and there\nis no reason to expect a default within the relevant period;\nNote In rule 4.3.3, the category performing excludes exposures\nclassified as special mention.\n(b) it must not include any contingent inflow; and\nGuidance for subrule (2) (b)\nContingent inflow would include expected returns on profit-sharing\ninstruments.\n(c) it must not include any inflow that would be received from an\nasset in the firm’s HQLA portfolio.\nGuidance for subrule (2) (c)\nIn a stressed situation, the assets in the firm’s HQLA portfolio would already\nhave been monetised.

The requirement will\noblige firms to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the\ncomposition of their assets and off-balance-sheet activities.\n(2) A stable funding profile is intended to reduce the likelihood that\ndisruptions to a firm’s regular sources of funding will erode its\nliquidity position in a way that would increase the risk of its failure,\nand might lead to broader systemic stress.\n(3) The requirement is intended to limit firms’ reliance on short-term\nwholesale funding, promote funding stability, and encourage better\nassessment of funding risk on and off firms’ balance-sheets.\n8.6.2 Definitions for Part 8.6\n(1) In this Part:\nASF for a liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business firm means\nthe amount of its available stable funding, calculated in accordance\nwith this Part.\npage 480 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nNet stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.6\nfirms\nRule 8.6.3\ncarrying value of a capital instrument, liability or asset is the value\ngiven for the instrument, liability or asset in the prudential returns of\nthe firm concerned.\nnet stable funding ratio has the meaning given by rule 8.6.3.\nNSFR means net stable funding ratio.\nRSF for a liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business firm means\nthe amount of its required stable funding, calculated in accordance\nwith this Part.\n(2) Expressions used in this Part that are defined in Part 8.4 have the same\nrespective meanings in this Part as in Part 8.4.\nNote The following expressions, used in this Part, are defined in Part 8.4:\n• encumbered and unencumbered (see rule 8.4.4)\n• financial institution (see rule 8.4.3)\n• financing facility (see rule 8.4.39)\n• HQLA (and references to levels of HQLA) (see rule 8.4.3 and rules 8.4.10\nto 8.4.13)\n• liquidity facility (see rule 8.4.39).\n8.6.3 What NSFR is\n(1) A liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business firm’s NSFR,\nexpressed as a percentage, is:\n𝐴𝑆𝐹\n×100.\n𝑅𝑆𝐹\n(2) The ASF and RSF are to be calculated in accordance with this Part.\n8.6.4 Obligation to maintain NSFR\nA liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business firm must maintain\nan NSFR of at least 100%. That is, its ASF must always be equal to\nor greater than its RSF.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 481\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.6 Net stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking\nbusiness firms\nRule 8.6.5\n8.6.5 Obligation to notify Regulatory Authority if NSFR\nrequirement not met\n(1) A liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business firm must notify\nthe Regulatory Authority in writing immediately (but within\n3 business days) if the firm ceases to meet its NSFR requirement (or\nbecomes aware of circumstances that may result in its ceasing to meet\nthat requirement).\n(2) In the notification the firm must clearly explain:\n(a) why it ceased to meet, or thinks it may cease to meet, the\nrequirement;\n(b) when it expects to again be able to meet the requirement; and\n(c) what it has done and will do to ensure that it meets the\nrequirement in future, or continues to meet it, as the case\nrequires.\nGuidance\nAn Islamic banking business firm that gives such a notification should discuss with\nthe Regulatory Authority what further steps it should take to deal with the situation.\n8.6.6 Application of NSFR to financial group\n(1) For calculating a consolidated NSFR for a financial group, assets held\nto meet an Islamic banking business firm’s NSFR may be included in\nthe parent entity’s stable funding only so far as the related liabilities\nare reflected in the parent entity’s NSFR. Any surplus of assets held\nat the firm may be treated as forming part of the parent entity’s stable\nfunding only if those assets would be freely available to the parent\nentity during a period of stress.\n(2) When calculating its NSFR on a consolidated basis, a cross-border\nIslamic banking group must apply the rules of its home jurisdiction\nto all the legal entities being consolidated, except for the treatment of\nretail and small business deposits. Such deposits for a consolidated\nentity must be treated according to the rules in the jurisdiction in\nwhich the entity operates.\npage 482 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nNet stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.6\nfirms\nRule 8.6.7\n(3) A cross-border Islamic banking group must not take excess stable\nfunding into account in calculating its consolidated NSFR if there is\nreasonable doubt about whether the funding would be available\nduring a period of stress.\nGuidance\nAsset transfer restrictions (for example, ring-fencing measures, non-convertibility\nof local currency, foreign exchange controls) in jurisdictions in which an Islamic\nbanking group operates would affect the availability of liquidity by restricting the\ntransfer of assets and funding within the group. The consolidated NSFR should\nreflect the restrictions consistently with this Part. For example, assets held to meet\na local NSFR requirement by a subsidiary that is being consolidated can be included\nin the consolidated NSFR to the extent that the assets are used to cover the funding\nrequirements of that subsidiary, even if the assets are subject to restrictions on\ntransfer. If the assets held in excess of the total funding requirements are not\ntransferable, the firm should not count that funding.\n8.6.7 Determining maturity of instruments when calculating\nNSFR\n(1) When an Islamic banking business firm is determining the maturity\nof an equity or liability instrument, it must assume that a call option\nwill be exercised at the earliest possible date that is permissible under\nShari’a.\n(2) In particular, if the market expects a liability to be exercised before\nits legal final maturity date, the firm must assign the liability to the\ncategory that is consistent with the market expectation.\n(3) For long-dated liabilities, the firm may treat only the part of cash\nflows falling at or beyond the 6-month and 1-year time horizons as\nhaving an effective residual maturity of 6 months or more and 1 year\nor more, respectively.\n8.6.8 Calculating NSFR Shari’a-compliant hedging liability\namounts\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must calculate the value of a\nShari’a-compliant hedging liability based on the replacement cost for\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 483\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.6 Net stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking\nbusiness firms\nRule 8.6.8\nthe contract (obtained by marking to market) if the contract has a\nnegative value.\n(2) If there is a netting agreement with the counterparty that satisfies both\nof the conditions in subrule (3), and all of the other conditions in\nsubrule (4) are met, the replacement cost for the set of exposures\ncovered by the agreement is taken to be the net replacement cost.\n(3) The conditions for the netting agreement are as follows:\n(a) under the agreement the firm would have a claim to receive, or\nan obligation to pay, only the net amount of the mark-to-market\nvalues of the transactions if the counterparty were to fail to\nperform;\n(b) the agreement does not contain a walkaway clause.\n(4) The other conditions are as follows:\n(a) the firm holds a written, reasoned legal opinion that the relevant\ncourts and administrative authorities would find the firm’s\nexposure to be the net amount referred to in subrule (3) (a) under\neach of the following laws:\n(i) the law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is\nestablished;\n(ii) if a foreign branch of the counterparty is involved, the law\nof the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;\n(iii) the law that governs the individual transactions;\n(iv) the law that governs the netting agreement (and any other\nagreement necessary to effect the netting);\n(b) the firm has procedures to ensure that netting arrangements are\nkept under review in the light of possible changes in the relevant\nlaw;\n(c) the Regulatory Authority is satisfied that the netting agreement\nis enforceable under all of the laws referred to in paragraph (a).\npage 484 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nNet stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group A Islamic banking business Part 8.6\nfirms\nRule 8.6.9\n(5) Collateral lodged in the form of variation margin in connection with\nShari’a-compliant hedging contracts, regardless of the asset type,\nmust be deducted from the negative replacement cost amount.\n8.6.9 Determining maturity of assets\n(1) When determining the maturity of an asset, an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm must assume that any option to extend that maturity will\nbe exercised.\n(2) In particular, if the market expects the maturity of an asset to be\nextended, the firm must assign the asset to the category that is\nconsistent with the market expectation.\n(3) For an amortising loan, the firm may treat the part that comes due\nwithin 1 year as having residual maturity of less than 1 year.\n8.6.10 What assets should be included\n(1) Subject to subrule (2), when determining its RSF, an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm:\n(a) must include financial instruments, foreign currencies and\ncommodities for which a purchase order has been executed; but\n(b) must not include financial instruments, foreign currencies and\ncommodities for which a sales order has been executed;\neven if the transactions have not been reflected in the firm’s balance-\nsheet under a settlement-date accounting model.\n(2) Subrule (1) applies only if:\n(a) the relevant transactions are not reflected as Shari’a-compliant\nhedging or secured financing transactions in the firm’s balance-\nsheet;

To achieve that equivalence, both transactions are settled through\nthe same settlement system and the settlement arrangements are\nsupported by cash or intraday financing facilities intended to ensure\nthat settlement of both transactions will occur by the end of the\nbusiness day and that the linkages to collateral flows do not result in\nthe unwinding of net cash settlement.\n8.6.13 Calculating NSFR Shari’a-compliant hedging asset\namounts\n(1) When determining its RSF, an Islamic banking business firm must\ncalculate the value of a Shari’a-compliant hedging asset first based\non the replacement cost for the contract (obtained by marking to\nmarket) if the asset has a positive value.\n(2) If there is a netting agreement with the counterparty that satisfies both\nof the conditions in rule 8.6.8 (3), and all of the other conditions in\nrule 8.6.8 (4) are met, the replacement cost for the set of exposures\ncovered by the agreement is taken to be the net replacement cost.\n(3) Collateral received in connection with a Shari’a-compliant hedging\ncontract does not offset the positive replacement cost amount,\nregardless of whether or not netting is permitted under the bank’s\naccounting or risk-based framework, unless:\n(a) the collateral is received in the form of cash variation margin;\nand\n(b) all of the conditions in subrule (4) are met.\n(4) The conditions are the following:\n(a) either:\n(i) the trades are cleared through a qualifying central\ncounterparty (see subrule (6));

The requirement will\noblige firms to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the\ncomposition of their assets and off-balance-sheet activities.\n(2) A stable funding profile is intended to reduce the likelihood that\ndisruptions to a firm’s regular sources of funding will erode its\nliquidity position in a way that would increase the risk of its failure\nand might lead to broader systemic stress.\n(3) The requirement is intended to limit firms’ reliance on short-term\nwholesale funding, promote funding stability, and encourage better\nassessment of funding risk on and off firms’ balance-sheets.\n(4) This Part sets out an alternative approach to the maintenance of stable\nfunding that is intended to be appropriate for certain Islamic banking\nbusiness firms that, because of their business model, could not meet\na requirement to maintain a net stable funding ratio in accordance\nwith Part 8.6.\n8.7.2 Definitions for Part 8.7\nExpressions used in this Part that are defined in Part 8.4 or 8.6 have\nthe same respective meanings in this Part as in Part 8.4 or 8.6, as the\ncase may be.\npage 500 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nNet stable funding ratio—liquidity risk group B Islamic banking business Part 8.7\nfirms\nRule 8.7.3\n8.7.3 What NSFR is\n(1) A liquidity risk group B Islamic banking business firm’s NSFR,\nexpressed as a percentage, is:\n𝐴𝑆𝐹\n×100.\n𝑅𝑆𝐹\n(2) The ASF and RSF are to be calculated in accordance with this Part.\n8.7.4 Obligation to maintain NSFR\nA liquidity risk group B Islamic banking business firm must maintain,\nduring each calendar month, an average NSFR of at least the\npercentage that the Regulatory Authority directs the firm to maintain.\n8.7.5 Obligation to notify Regulatory Authority if NSFR\nrequirement not met\n(1) A liquidity risk group B Islamic banking business firm must notify\nthe Regulatory Authority in writing immediately (but within\n3 business days) if the firm ceases to meet its NSFR requirement (or\nbecomes aware of circumstances that may result in its ceasing to meet\nthat requirement).\n(2) In the notification the firm must clearly explain:\n(a) why it ceased to meet, or thinks it may cease to meet, the\nrequirement;\n(b) when it expects to again be able to meet the requirement;

For example, a cheque is usually payable at sight.\n2 On a particular day, the sight–7 calendar days time-band covers assets\nmaturing, or liabilities payable, on presentation or within 7 calendar days. The\n8–30 calendar days time-band covers assets maturing, or liabilities payable,\nfrom 8 to 30 calendar days later.\n3 This Part takes no account of assets or liabilities with an unspecified maturity,\nor a specified maturity that is more than 30 calendar days in the future.\n8.8.2 Application—Part 8.8\nThis Part applies to all Islamic banking business firms.\n8.8.3 Determining net cumulative maturity mismatch\nAn Islamic banking business firm determines its net cumulative\nmaturity mismatch for each time-band by:\n(a) determining what assets and liabilities are to be taken into\naccount, and their maturities;\n(b) assigning each asset and each liability to a time-band;\n(c) adding up the values of the assets and the liabilities assigned to\neach time-band; and\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 507\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.8 Limits on net cumulative maturity mismatch\nRule 8.8.4\n(d) subtracting liabilities from assets in each time-band.\n8.8.4 Assigning liabilities to time-bands\n(1) A liability must be assigned to a time-band according to its earliest\ncontractual maturity.\n(2) A contingent liability must be included in the firm’s liabilities unless\nthe conditions necessary to crystallise it are unlikely to be fulfilled.\nGuidance for subrule (2)\nIn deciding whether it is likely that the conditions necessary to crystallise a\ncontingent liability will be fulfilled, an authorised firm could rely on general market\ninformation, its knowledge of the counterparty and general behavioural analysis.\n8.8.5 Assigning assets to time-bands\n(1) An asset must be assigned to a time-band according to its latest\ncontractual maturity, except that:\n(a) an undrawn committed standby facility provided by another\nIslamic banking business firm is to be treated as being at sight;\n(b) readily marketable assets (see subrule (2)) are to be treated as\nbeing at sight; and\n(c) assets that have been lodged as collateral are not to be included.\n(2) An asset is readily marketable if all of the following are true:\n(a) the currency in which it is denominated is freely tradeable;\n(b) prices are regularly quoted for it;\n(c) it is regularly traded;\n(d) it can readily be monetised on a recognised exchange.\n(3) On a case by case basis, the Regulatory Authority may allow an\nIslamic banking business firm to include, in the sight–7 calendar days\ntime-band, a longer-term asset that is relatively easy to monetise.\n8.8.6 Haircuts for readily marketable assets\n(1) The haircuts to be applied to readily marketable assets of each kind\nare as set out in table 8.8.6.

and\n(b) must be appropriately documented.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 511\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.9 Monitoring\nRule 8.9.1\nPart 8.9 Monitoring\nNote for Part 8.9\nThis Part applies to all Islamic banking business firms—see rule 8.1.4.\nDivision 8.9.A Introductory\n8.9.1 Introduction—Part 8.9\n(1) This Part imposes requirements for Islamic banking business firms to\nmonitor certain indicators of their liquidity.\n(2) The indicators are:\n(a) contractual maturity mismatches;\n(b) concentration of funding;\n(c) available unencumbered assets; and\n(d) LCR by significant currencies.\n8.9.2 What monitoring requires\nA requirement in this Part for an Islamic banking business firm to\nmonitor an indicator requires the firm to be continuously aware of the\nindicator, and to re-evaluate it as often as necessary, given:\n(a) the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s business; and\n(b) the prevailing market conditions.\nDivision 8.9.B Monitoring maturity mismatches\n8.9.3 Purpose of monitoring\nThe monitoring of an Islamic banking business firm’s contractual\nmaturity mismatches is intended to identify gaps between contractual\ninflows and outflows in particular time-bands, and to reveal the extent\nto which the firm relies on maturity transformation.\npage 512 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nMonitoring Part 8.9\nRule 8.9.4\n8.9.4 Contractual maturity mismatch\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm:\n(a) must monitor its contractual maturity mismatches, according to\ntime-bands directed by the Regulatory Authority; and\n(b) must carry out its own maturity mismatch analyses, based on\nrealistic, going-concern assumptions about the behaviour of\ninflows and outflows of funds in both normal situations and\nstress situations.\n(2) The analyses should be based on the firm’s strategic and business\nplans and must be shared with, and discussed with, the Authority.\n(3) The firm must be able to show how it plans to bridge any identified\ngaps in its internally generated maturity mismatches, and to explain\nany differences between the assumptions applied and the contractual\nterms.\nDivision 8.9.C Monitoring concentration of funding\n8.9.5 Purpose of monitoring\nThe monitoring of the concentration of an Islamic banking business\nfirm’s funding is meant:\n(a) to identify sources of the firm’s wholesale funding that are of\nsuch significance that the withdrawal of that funding could\ncause liquidity problems for the firm; and\n(b) therefore, to encourage the firm to diversify its sources of such\nfunding.\n8.9.6 What is to be monitored\nAn Islamic banking business firm must monitor:\n(a) concentration of funding by counterparty;\n(b) concentration of funding by instrument or product; and\n(c) concentration of funding by currency.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 513\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.9 Monitoring\nRule 8.9.7\n8.9.7 Concentration of funding by counterparty\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must calculate its concentration of\nfunding by counterparty as a percentage for each significant\ncounterparty or significant group of connected counterparties, by\nmeans of the following formula:\n𝑁\n×100\n𝑇\nwhere:\nN is the total, for the counterparty or group, of:\n(a) all liabilities to the counterparty or group; and\n(b) all other direct borrowings, both secured and unsecured (such as\nby overnight commercial paper or certificates of deposit) from\nthe counterparty or group.\nT is the firm’s total balance-sheet.\n(2) For subrule (1):\n(a) a counterparty or group is significant if liabilities to it account\nin total for more than 1% of the firm’s total liabilities; and\n(b) a group of connected counterparties is 2 or more counterparties\nthat are connected (as defined in rule 5.1.3).\n(3) For this rule, if the firm is a member of a corporate group, the firm\nmust treat intra-group deposits and deposits from related parties as\ndeposits by a single counterparty.\nGuidance\nDeposits from within the group and from related parties are to be identified because\nof the possible limitations on intra-group transactions under stressed conditions.\n8.9.8 Concentration of funding by instrument or product\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must calculate its concentration of\nfunding by instrument or product as a percentage for each significant\npage 514 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nMonitoring Part 8.9\nRule 8.9.9\ninstrument or significant product (or significant type of instrument or\nsignificant type of product), by means of the following formula:\n𝑁\n×100\n𝑇\nwhere:\nN is the total, for the instrument or product (or type of instrument or\ntype of product) of all liabilities arising from the instrument, product\nor type of instrument or product.\nT is the firm’s total balance-sheet.\n(2) For subrule (1), an instrument or product, or a type of instrument or\nproduct, is significant if it accounts in total for more than 1% of the\nfirm’s total liabilities.\n8.9.9 Concentration of funding by currency\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must monitor its concentration of\nfunding by currency by maintaining a list of its liabilities, maturing\nin each time-band, denominated in each significant currency.\n(2) For subrule (1):\n(a) a currency is significant for the firm if liabilities denominated\nin it account in total for more than 5% of the firm’s total\nliabilities; and\n(b) the time-bands are as follows:\n(i) less than 1 month;\n(ii) 1-3 months;\n(iii) 3-6 months;\n(iv) 6-12 months;\n(v) more than 12 months;\n(vi) unspecified maturity.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 515\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 8 Liquidity risk\nPart 8.9 Monitoring\nRule 8.9.10\nDivision 8.9.D Monitoring available unencumbered\nassets\n8.9.10 Purpose of monitoring\nThe monitoring of an Islamic banking business firm’s available\nunencumbered assets and collateral is meant to track assets and\ncollateral:\n(a) that could be used in secondary markets as collateral to raise\nadditional HQLA (as defined in rule 8.4.3) or secured funding;\nor\n(b) that would be eligible as collateral for a central bank’s standing\nfacility.\n8.9.11 What is to be monitored\n(1) In this rule:\nunencumbered has the meaning given by rule 8.4.4.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm must monitor all of the following:\n(a) the amount, type and location of the firm’s available\nunencumbered assets that are useable as collateral in secondary\nmarkets;\n(b) collateral, received from customers, that the firm is permitted to\ndeliver or re-pledge, and how much of such collateral it is\ndelivering or re-pledging;\n(c) the firm’s available unencumbered assets that are eligible as\ncollateral for central banks’ standing facilities;\n(d) the estimated haircut that the secondary market or relevant\ncentral bank would require for each asset;\n(e) the costs likely to be involved.\n(3) In doing so, the firm must categorise its available unencumbered\nassets and collateral by significant currency. A currency is significant\nif the firm’s stock of available unencumbered assets and collateral\npage 516 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nLiquidity risk Chapter 8\nMonitoring Part 8.9\nRule 8.9.12\ndenominated in the currency amounts to 5% or more of the firm’s\ntotal amount of such assets and collateral.\n(4) The firm must monitor:\n(a) the expected monetised value of such assets and collateral\n(rather than their notional amount); and\n(b) where the assets or collateral are held (in terms of both their\nlocation and what business lines have access to them).\nDivision 8.9.E Monitoring LCR by significant\ncurrencies\n8.9.12 Purpose of monitoring\nThe monitoring of an Islamic banking business firm’s LCR (as\ndefined in rule 8.4.3) by significant currencies is meant to track\npossible currency mismatches.\n8.9.13 What is to be monitored\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must monitor:\n(a) its stock of HQLA (as defined in rule 8.4.3) in each significant\ncurrency; and\n(b) its expected total net cash outflows (net of any hedges) in each\nsuch currency over the next 30 calendar days.\n(2) For subrule (1):\n(a) the firm’s total net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days\nare to be calculated in accordance with rule 8.4.21; and\n(b) a currency is significant for the firm if liabilities denominated\nin it amount to 5% or more of the firm’s total liabilities.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 517\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Group risk\nPart 9.1 General\nRule 9.1.1\nChapter 9 Group risk\nPart 9.1 General\n9.1.1 Introduction\n(1) This Chapter sets out the requirements for an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm’s management of corporate group risk and the\nmeasurement of financial group capital requirement and resources.\n(2) Group membership can be a source of both strength and weakness to\nan Islamic banking business firm. The purpose of group risk\nrequirements is to ensure that the firm takes into account the risks\nrelated to its membership of a corporate group and maintains\nadequate capital resources so as to exceed its financial group capital\nrequirement.\n9.1.2 Corporate group and financial group\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s corporate group is made up of:\n(a) the firm;\n(b) any parent entity of the firm;\n(c) any subsidiary (direct or indirect) of the firm; and\n(d) any subsidiary (direct or indirect) of a parent entity of the firm.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm’s financial group is made up of:\n(a) the firm;\n(b) any subsidiary (direct or indirect) of the firm, if the subsidiary\nbelongs to a sector of the financial industry; and\n(c) any entity that the Regulatory Authority directs the firm to\ninclude.\n(3) An Islamic banking business firm may apply to the Regulatory\nAuthority for approval to exclude an entity from its financial group.\nThe authority will grant such an approval only after the firm satisfies\npage 518 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGroup risk Chapter 9\nGeneral Part 9.1\nRule 9.1.3\nthe authority that inclusion of the entity would be misleading or\ninappropriate for the purposes of supervision.\nGuidance\nThe Regulatory Authority would consider a range of factors when requiring an\nIslamic banking business firm to treat another entity as part of its financial group.\nThese factors would include regulatory risk factors, including direct and indirect\nparticipation, influence or contractual obligations, interconnectedness, intra-group\nexposures, intra-group services, regulatory status and legal framework.\n9.1.3 Requirements—group risk\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must effectively manage risks\narising from its membership in a corporate group.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm that is a member of a corporate\ngroup must establish and maintain systems and controls to monitor:\n(a) the effect on the firm of its membership in the group;\n(b) the effect on the firm of the activities of other members of the\ngroup;\n(c) compliance with group supervision and reporting requirements;\nand\n(d) funding within the group.\nGuidance\nAn Islamic banking business firm may take into account its position within its\ncorporate group. It would be reasonable for a small firm within a larger group to\nplace some reliance on its parent to ensure that there are appropriate systems and\ncontrols to manage group risk.\n(3) The firm must also have systems to enable it to calculate its financial\ngroup capital requirement and resources. The systems must include a\nmeans of analysing realistic scenarios and the effects on the financial\ngroup’s capital requirement and resources if those scenarios occurred.\n9.1.4 Role of governing body—group risk\nAn Islamic banking business firm’s governing body must ensure that\nthe firm’s group risk management policy addresses, on a group-wide\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 519\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Group risk\nPart 9.1 General\nRule 9.1.4\nbasis, all risks arising from the firm’s relationship with every other\nmember of its group.\npage 520 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGroup risk Chapter 9\nGroup capital requirement and resources Part 9.2\nRule 9.2.1\nPart 9.2 Group capital requirement and\nresources\n9.2.1 Application of Part 9.2\n(1) This Part does not apply to an Islamic banking business firm if:\n(a) the firm is already subject to group prudential supervision by the\nRegulatory Authority because another member of its group is an\nauthorised firm; or\n(b) the Regulatory Authority has confirmed in writing, in response\nto an application from the firm, that the authority is satisfied that\nthe group is the subject of consolidated prudential supervision\nby an appropriate regulator.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm that has received confirmation must\nimmediately inform the authority in writing if any circumstance on\nwhich the confirmation was based changes.\n9.2.2 Financial group capital requirement and resources\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must ensure, at all times, that its\nfinancial group capital resources exceed its financial group capital\nrequirement.\n(2) In calculating its financial group capital resources, the firm must not\ninclude capital resources or adjusted capital resources (as the case\nmay be) of subsidiaries or participations of that group to the extent\nthat those capital resources or adjusted capital resources exceed the\ncapital requirement for that subsidiary or participation and are not\nfreely transferable within the group.\nGuidance\n1 Capital resources or adjusted capital resources would not be freely transferable\nif they are subject to an obligation to maintain minimum capital requirements\nto comply with domestic solvency requirements, or to comply with debt\ncovenants.\n2 If an Islamic banking business firm breaches rule 9.2.2(1), the Regulatory\nAuthority would take into account the circumstances of the case, including any\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 521\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 9 Group risk\nPart 9.2 Group capital requirement and resources\nRule 9.2.3\nremedial steps taken by another regulator or the firm, in deciding what\nenforcement action to take.\n9.2.3 Solo limits to apply to group\nUnless the Regulatory Authority directs otherwise, a prudential limit\nin these rules that applies to an Islamic banking business firm also\napplies to the firm’s financial group.\nExamples\n1 The restriction in rule 5.3.3(2) (that the total of an Islamic banking business\nfirm’s net exposures to a counterparty or connected counterparties must not\nexceed 25% of its regulatory capital) applies to the firm’s financial group, so\nthat the group’s net exposures to a counterparty or connected counterparties\nmust not exceed 25% of the group’s regulatory capital.\n2 Similarly, the restriction in rule 5.3.3(3) (that the total of all of the firm’s net\nlarge exposures must not exceed 800% of its regulatory capital) applies to the\nfirm’s financial group, so that the group’s total large exposures to\ncounterparties or connected counterparties must not exceed 800% of the\ngroup’s regulatory capital.\npage 522 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nGeneral Part 10.1\nRule 10.1.1\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.1 General\n10.1.1 Introduction\n(1) This Chapter sets out the minimum capital requirements to cover:\n(a) the credit risk and market risk arising from the holding, by an\nIslamic banking business firm, of sukuk in the banking book;\nand\n(b) the firm’s other sukuk-related exposures arising from the firm\nbeing (or acting in the capacity of) an originator, issuer, provider\nof credit enhancement or provider of a liquidity facility in a\nsecuritisation.\nNote For credit risk arising from sukuk in the firm’s trading book, Chapter 4\napplies. For market risk arising from sukuk in the firm’s trading book,\nChapter 6 applies.\n(2) This Chapter also sets out the requirements for allowing capital relief\nto an Islamic banking business firm.\n10.1.2 Sukuk\n(1) Sukuk are certificates that represent a holder’s proportionate\nownership in an undivided part of an asset or pool of assets where the\nholder assumes all rights and obligations to the asset or pool.\n(2) The assets that may be the subject of sukuk include:\n(a) tangible assets (including istisna assets);\n(b) intangible assets;\n(c) financial assets;\n(d) usufructs (including ijarah lease assets);\n(e) services;\n(f) equity participation in business ventures (such as mudarabah\nand musharakah);\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 523\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.1 General\nRule 10.1.3\n(g) a pool of the kinds of assets mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (d);\nand\nNote The pooling of different kinds of assets allows for greater\nmobilisation of funds. For example, an SPE would be able to issue\ntradeable sukuk for financial assets that would not normally be\ntradeable on their own, if the SPE packages a pool made up of a\nproportion of financial assets and tangible assets.\n(h) any other asset approved in writing by the Regulatory Authority.\n(3) The assets that are the subject of sukuk must be Shari’a-compliant and\nreadily identifiable. The assets may be in a specific project or\ninvestment activity that must itself be Shari’a-compliant.\n10.1.3 Tradeability of sukuk\nSukuk are not tradeable unless their trading is in accordance with\nShari’a.\nGuidance\n1 As a general principle, sukuk with underlying financial assets solely in the\nform of receivables (debts) are not tradeable.\n2 Sukuk that are made up of financial assets may be traded by a firm if:\n(a) the financial assets are combined with tangible assets and the value of\ntangible assets in the pool is not less than the percentage determined by\nthe firm’s Shari’a supervisory board (this kind of sukuk is sometimes\ncalled sukuk al-istithmar); or\n(b) the firm is selling all of its assets (or a pool of assets with a standing\nfinancial obligation) and the financial assets are incidental to the\ntangible assets or usufructs being sold and are unavoidably included in\nthe sale.\n10.1.4 Categories of sukuk according to ownership of assets\nSukuk may also be categorised, based on the sukuk holders’\nownership of the underlying assets, into:\n(a) asset-backed sukuk where legal and beneficial ownership of the\nunderlying assets are transferred to the sukuk holders; and\n(b) asset-based sukuk where only beneficial ownership of the\nunderlying assets is transferred (through a trust) to the sukuk\nholders.\npage 524 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nGeneral Part 10.1\nRule 10.1.4\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 525\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.2 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 10.2.1\nPart 10.2 Securitisation and re-\nsecuritisation\nDivision 10.2.A General\n10.2.1 Securitisation\n(1) Securitisation, in relation to an Islamic banking business firm, is the\nprocess of creating and issuing sukuk or tranches of sukuk. In\nsecuritisation:\n(a) payments of the principal and profits are derived from the cash\nflows generated by the securitised assets (that is, by the assets\nunderlying the sukuk); and\n(b) legal or beneficial ownership to the underlying assets is\ntransferred to the investors in the form of sukuk.\nA reference to securitisation includes re-securitisation.\n(2) The structure of a securitisation must be Shari’a-compliant.\nNote Under rule 10.1.2 (3), the assets that are the subject of sukuk (and the\nspecific project or investment activity where the assets are) must also be\nShari’a-compliant.\n10.2.2 Parties to securitisation\n(1) For purposes of calculating an Islamic banking business firm’s capital\nrequirements, the parties to a securitisation are the originator, the\nissuer and the investors.\nNote 1 Depending on the securitisation structure, an Islamic banking business\nfirm may be (or act in the capacity of) originator, issuer, investor or any\n1 or more of the following:\n(a) a manager of the sukuk issuance;\n(b) a sponsor of the sukuk issuance;\n(c) an adviser to the sukuk issuance;\n(d) an entity to place the securities with investors;\n(e) a provider of credit enhancement;\n(f) a provider of a liquidity facility;\npage 526 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 10.2\nRule 10.2.3\n(g) a servicer to carry out certain activities usually carried out by the\nmanager of the sukuk issuance in relation to the underlying assets.\nNote 2 An Islamic banking business firm may act as sponsor of a sukuk issuance\nor similar programme involving assets of a customer. As sponsor, the\nfirm earns fees to manage or advise on the programme, place the\nsecurities with investors, provide credit enhancement or provide a\nliquidity facility.\nNote 3 Depending on the securitisation structure, a servicer (instead of the\nmanager of the sukuk or issuer) may carry out the following activities:\n(a) handling related taxes;\n(b) managing escrow accounts;\n(c) remitting payments;\n(d) obtaining takaful;\n(e) maintaining the underlying assets on behalf of the lessor (sukuk\nholders) in ijarah or IMB sukuk.\nNote 4 The originator of a sukuk issuance may act as servicer of the underlying\nassets.\n(2) The contractual terms of the sukuk issuance determine the rights of\nthe sukuk holders to the securitised assets.\nNote For the rights of sukuk-holders, see rule 10.2.10 (Effects of true sale on\nsukuk holders).\n10.2.3 Firm acting as originator\nAn Islamic banking business firm that acts as originator of a sukuk\nissuance must transfer (through an SPE) the ownership of assets held\nby it to sukuk holders.\nGuidance\n1 As an originator, an Islamic banking business firm may obtain either or both\nof the following benefits:\n(a) increased liquidity, since a relatively illiquid asset (such as an asset held\nas lessor in an ijarah or IMB contract) is converted into cash paid by the\ninvestors;\n(b) reduced capital requirements, insofar as the securitisation permits the\nfirm to exclude, from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets,\nexposures relating to the underlying assets.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 527\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.2 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 10.2.4\n2 To obtain the benefit of reduced capital requirements, the firm must ensure\nthat the securitisation structure enables it to derecognise, from its balance\nsheet, the underlying assets. For the criteria for derecognition, see rule 10.2.26.\n10.2.4 Firm acting as issuer\nAn Islamic banking business firm may act as issuer of sukuk.\nGuidance\n1 An Islamic banking business firm may act as issuer of asset-backed sukuk by\npackaging assets into a pool and transferring legal and beneficial ownership of\nthe assets to sukuk holders by true sale under rule 10.2.8.\n2 An Islamic banking business firm may act as issuer of asset-based sukuk by\npackaging assets into a pool and transferring only beneficial ownership of the\nassets to sukuk holders because there is some obstacle to the transfer of legal\nownership. Such an obstacle would, for example, exist if the assets were\npurchased by the firm from the central government of a state and the transfer\nof full ownership would require special legislation.\n10.2.5 Collateral security structure\n(1) A collateral security structure may be used in some sukuk, such as\nthose based on project financing. The security interest arising from\nthe structure must be perfected (or perfectible) and that interest must\nbe the only claim on the collateral.\nNote In this rule, collateral:\n(a) arises from the structure (for example, the asset or project that is\nthe subject of financing in a joint venture between the SPE and\nanother party); and\n(b) is used to mitigate the underlying exposures of the securitisation.\n(2) The collateral security structure must be supported by a written and\nreasoned opinion of a qualified legal counsel. The legal opinion must\nconclude that the security interest is perfected (or perfectible) and that\nthere are no prior or subsequent claims on the collateral.\n(3) The legal opinion must address:\n(a) the nature of the security interest;\n(b) the enforceability of the security interest against third parties;\n(c) perfection requirements (such as notices and registration); and\npage 528 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 10.2\nRule 10.2.6\n(d) the effects of the issuer’s bankruptcy on perfection.\nGuidance\nThe Regulatory Authority expects the legal opinion to consider that, in many\njurisdictions:\n● rahn (mortgage or other pledge of assets) is possessory in nature so as to\nmake perfection a particularly difficult issue\n● bankruptcy laws, the concept of perfection and the priorities in the\ndistribution of assets are not well developed.\nDivision 10.2.B Securitisation process\n10.2.6 Sukuk securitisation\nThe process of a sukuk securitisation is:\n(a) first, the origination of assets;\n(b) second, the transfer of the assets to an SPE which is created to\nissue the securities and manage the assets on behalf of the sukuk\nholders; and\n(c) third, the issuance of the sukuk to investors.\n10.2.7 Special purpose entities\n(1) A special purpose entity (or SPE) is a legal entity that is created\nsolely for a particular financial transaction or series of transactions.\n(2) An SPE may take the form of a limited partnership, limited liability\ncompany, corporation, trust or collective investment fund. An SPE\nmay also be established under a special law that allows the creation\nof SPEs.\n(3) Most sukuk securitisations require the creation of an SPE to:\n(a) hold the assets transferred by the originator;\n(b) issue sukuk based on the assets; and\n(c) act as intermediary between the originator and the sukuk holders.\nGuidance\n1 In conventional securitisations, the SPE must not have any other business. In\na sukuk securitisation, the SPE can be organised, for example, as a mudarabah,\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 529\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.2 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 10.2.8\nmusharakah or wakalah, but the requirement for the SPE to have no other\nbusiness continues to apply.\n2 By its nature, an SPE is a legal shell with only the specific assets transferred\nby the originator (that is, the SPE has no other property in which any other\nparty could have an interest). The transferred assets are effectively owned,\nlegally or through a trust, by the sukuk holders.\n(4) An SPE must be bankruptcy-remote from the originator. It must not\nbe consolidated with the originator for tax, accounting or legal\npurposes.\n10.2.8 Criteria for true sale\n(1) For asset-backed sukuk, ownership of the underlying assets must be\ntransferred to the sukuk holders (or to an SPE for their benefit) by a\ntrue sale under Shari’a.\n(2) The 4 main criteria for a true sale are:\n(a) the transfer must be such that:\n(i) it cannot be re-characterised by a court or other body as a\nsecured loan; or\n(ii) it cannot be avoided in a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding involving the originator of the assets;\nExample\nThe sale should not be a fraudulent transfer in anticipation of\nbankruptcy or a preference payment\n(b) the bankruptcy or insolvency of the originator must not affect\nthe assets transferred and the issuer of the sukuk must be able to\nenforce collection and other rights against the source of the\nincome without any hindrance resulting from the bankruptcy or\ninsolvency of the originator;\n(c) the transfer must be perfectible at the election of the issuer; and\n(d) the sale must be free and clear of all prior overriding liens.\npage 530 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 10.2\nRule 10.2.9\n(3) The transfer of assets must be evidenced by a written contract for their\nsale to the sukuk holders.\nNote For the covenants and declarations that must be included in the\ntransaction documents, see rule 10.2.27.\n10.2.9 Effects of true sale on originator\nFor asset-backed sukuk, the effects of a true sale on the originator\ninclude:\n(a) derecognition, from the originator’s balance sheet, of the assets\nsold, so that the assets become bankruptcy-remote (and\ntherefore not subject to claw back by a liquidator in the event of\nthe originator’s liquidation); and\n(b) the originator ceasing to have any financial liability to the sukuk\nholders in relation to the assets.\n10.2.10 Effects of true sale on sukuk holders\nFor asset-backed sukuk, the effects of a true sale on sukuk holders\ninclude:\n(a) giving the holders a legally recognised ownership interest over\nthe underlying assets;\n(b) giving the holders realisable security over the underlying assets;\n(c) giving the holders a right to payments of the principal and\nprofits;\n(d) insulating the holders from exposure to any financial problems\nof the originator;\n(e) exposing the holders (as owners) to losses in the event of\nimpairment of the assets; and\n(f) in case of a default of the sukuk (for example, because ijarah\nlessees of the assets fail to pay what is due), giving the holders\na claim to the assets (but not to the originator).\nNote In contrast to rule 10.2.10 (f), recourse to the originator is possible\nin some asset-based sukuk (see rule 10.2.14 (2) (b) (iii))\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 531\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.2 Securitisation and re-securitisation\nRule 10.2.11\n10.2.11 Prohibition against advanced undertaking to repurchase\n(1) If a sukuk issuance satisfies the criteria for a true sale of the assets,\nthe risks to the sukuk holders of the payments of the principal and\nprofits must depend on the performance of the underlying assets and\nnot on any other mechanism such as a repurchase undertaking.\nNote In a sukuk securitisation, the applicable risks are those of the underlying\nassets, and these will, in principle, be reflected in any credit rating issued\nby an ECRA.\n(2) The mudarib (investment manager), sharik (partner) or wakeel\n(agent) must not undertake in advance to repurchase the underlying\nassets at maturity for their nominal or par value.\n(3) A repurchase undertaking to cover risks arising from mudarabah\nsukuk, musharakah sukuk or wakalah sukuk may be built into the\nstructure of the sukuk only if the mudarib, sharik or wakeel\nundertakes to repurchase the assets at maturity for:\n(a) their net value;\n(b) their market value;\n(c) their fair value; or\n(d) a price to be agreed at the time of repurchase.\n(4) However, the originator (as lessee) of a securitisation of a pool of\nijarah assets may undertake to purchase the assets at maturity for\ntheir nominal or par value, but only if the originator is not also a\nmudarib, sharik or wakeel in relation to the securitisation.\n(5) In this rule:\nrepurchase undertaking means a unilateral binding promise, made\nby the originator to the issuer or trustee, to purchase the sukuk assets\nat a future date or on the occurrence of certain events (such as\nmaturity of the sukuk or exercise of early redemption right by sukuk\nholders).\npage 532 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nSecuritisation and re-securitisation Part 10.2\nRule 10.2.12\nDivision 10.2.C Risk management of securitisation\n10.2.12 Role of governing body—securitisation\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s governing body must oversee the\nfirm’s securitisation exposures.\n(2) The governing body:\n(a) must understand, and set the scope and purpose of, the firm’s\nsukuk securitisation;

The mechanisms for\ncredit enhancement include:\n(a) over-collateralisation;\n(b) excess spread;\n(c) cash collateral; and\n(d) takaful protection.\n(2) The purpose of credit enhancement is for the sukuk to obtain higher\ncredit rating from ECRAs (and thereby reduce both the credit risk to\nthe sukuk holders and the funding cost of the securitisation for the\noriginator).\nNote For the use of ECRAs:\n• generally, see Part 4.3\n• in relation to securitisations, see Division 10.2.E.\n10.2.17 Providing credit enhancement\n(1) Credit enhancement in a sukuk structure may be provided:\n(a) internally, through an issuer-provided credit enhancement\nstructure such as an excess spread reserve, over-collateralisation\nor a cash collateral account; or\n(b) externally, through a third-party guarantee credit enhancement\nstructure such as takaful or a cash collateral account.\n(2) In an issuer-provided credit enhancement, the issuer would provide\ncredit enhancement by assuming part of the credit risk of the\nunderlying assets.\n(3) In a third-party guarantee credit enhancement, a party (the guarantor)\nother than the issuer assumes (indefinitely or for a fixed period) all or\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 535\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.2 Part 4.3\nRule 10.2.18\npart of the credit risk. The guarantor must not have a right of recourse\nto the originator.\n(4) Unless the terms of the guarantee provide otherwise, a claim must\nfirst be made on the underlying assets before any claim is made\nagainst the guarantor.\nNote For the treatment of credit enhancement provided by sukuk structure, see\nrule 10.4.5.\n10.2.18 Credit enhancement—over-collateralisation\nAn originator may retain a small equity participation in a pool of\nsecuritised assets to provide over-collateralisation.\nExample\nThe originator of a securitisation of a pool of ijarah lease assets might securitise\n90% of the pool and retain 10% as an equity position (that is, a residual claim).\nThe sukuk holders would be entitled to income based on 90% of the rental\nincome from the pool, and the originator would be entitled to income based on\nthe remaining 10%.\n10.2.19 Credit enhancement—excess spread\n(1) Excess spread is the difference between:\n(a) the expected periodic net income from the securitised assets; and\n(b) the periodic amounts payable to the sukuk holders.\n(2) Excess spread may be built into a sukuk structure by the issuer\nretaining a percentage of the periodic net income if the net income is\nin excess of the target level of the periodic payments to the sukuk\nholders. The issuer must keep any amount retained in an excess\nspread reserve.\n(3) If the net income for a period falls below the level required to meet\nthe target level of the payments to the sukuk holders, the issuer may\nrelease an amount from the excess spread reserve to make good, in\nwhole or in part, the shortfall.\n(4) The issuer must not establish an excess spread reserve unless:\n(a) the reserve is disclosed in the transaction documents;\npage 536 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nPart 4.3 Part 10.2\nRule 10.2.20\n(b) a summary of the policies for transferring funds to and from the\nreserve is included in the transaction documents; and\n(c) the firm’s governing body has approved the basis for computing\nthe amounts to be transferred to and from the reserve.\n10.2.20 Credit enhancement—cash collateral account\n(1) Cash collateral account is a segregated trust account that is funded\nwhen a new series of sukuk is issued. The purpose of the account is\nto cover any shortfall (when the excess spread falls below zero) in the\npayment of coupons, principal or servicing expenses.\n(2) The account may be funded:\n(a) by the issuer; or\n(b) more commonly, by the originator or another third party through\nqarḍ.\n(3) The pooling and servicing agreements of the sukuk issuance must\nstate the amount of the cash collateral based on a specified percentage\nof the sukuk issued.\n(4) The amount in the account may be invested in high-rated sukuk to\ngenerate profits.\n10.2.21 Credit enhancement—takaful protection\nA third party may provide takaful protection to sukuk holders against\nlosses due to defaults or rating downgrades of sukuk.\nExample of default\nIn ijarah sukuk, non-payment of rentals or redemption price by the lessee\n(originator).\nNote Takaful protection against losses due to defaults or downgrades is\npermitted, because it is not a credit default swap in any way. The takaful\nparticipants have an insurable interest in the form of their credit\nexposures.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 537\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.2 Part 4.3\nRule 10.2.22\nDivision 10.2.E External ratings\n10.2.22 External credit rating agencies\n(1) Depending on the securitisation structure, 1 or more ECRAs may be\ninvolved in rating the sukuk securitisation. An Islamic banking\nbusiness firm must use only ECRAs to risk-weight securitisation\nexposures.\nNote For the use of ECRAs in general, see Part 4.3.\n(2) Because investors are not concerned with the credit strength of the\noriginator or issuer in a sukuk securitisation, an ECRA that is rating\nthe sukuk must assess the quality of the underlying pool of assets and\nthe robustness of the structure. In assigning a rating, the ECRA must\nconsider:\n(a) the quality of the asset portfolio;\n(b) the solvency of the originator or the issuer;\n(c) the perfection of the legal structure;\n(d) the tax risks;\n(e) the title to the securitised assets;\n(f) the risks of set-off and prepayment;\n(g) the nature and structure of the sukuk.\nNote A change in the rating for a sukuk issue may be due to deterioration in the\nperformance of the collateral, heavy utilisation of credit enhancement or\ndowngrade of a supporting rating (for example, a takaful company that\nwas underwriting takaful on the pool of the assets).\n(3) For asset-based sukuk (where only beneficial ownership of the\nunderlying assets is transferred), the rating will depend on a combined\nview of:\n(a) the strength of the rating of the originator or issuer; and\n(b) the quality of the asset pool.\n10.2.23 Ratings must be publicly available\n(1) A credit rating assigned by an ECRA must be publicly available.\npage 538 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nPart 4.3 Part 10.2\nRule 10.2.24\n(2) The loss and cash flow analysis for the securitisation, and the\nsensitivity of the rating to changes in the assumptions on which it was\nmade, must also be publicly available.\nGuidance\nInformation required under this rule should be published in an accessible form for\nfree. Information that is made available only to the parties to a securitisation is not\nconsidered publicly available.\n10.2.24 Ratings must be applied consistently\n(1) A credit rating assigned by an ECRA must be applied consistently\nacross a given type of securitisation exposure.\n(2) An Islamic banking business firm must not use an ECRA’s (the first\nECRA’s) credit rating for 1 or more tranches and another ECRA’s\nrating for other tranches within the same securitisation structure\n(whether or not those other tranches are rated by the first ECRA).\nNote Under rule 4.3.8:\n(a) if there are 2 different assessments by ECRAs, the higher risk-\nweight must be applied; and\n(b) if there are 3 or more different assessments by ECRAs, the\nassessments corresponding to the 2 lowest risk-weights should be\nreferred to and the higher of those 2 risk-weights must be applied.\n10.2.25 Effect of ratings of issuer and issue\nIf the issuer of sukuk is rated (but the issue is not), any eligible\ncollateral may be used for credit risk mitigation. If the issue is rated,\ncollateral included as part of the sukuk structure must not be used for\ncredit risk mitigation.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 539\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.2 Part 4.3\nRule 10.2.26\nDivision 10.2.F Risk transference, bankruptcy\nremoteness and credit risk\nassessment\n10.2.26 Recognition of risk transference (asset derecognition\ncriteria)\nThe originator of a sukuk issuance may exclude, from the calculation\nof its risk-weighted assets, exposures relating to the securitised assets\nonly if:\n(a) the immediate transferee of the underlying assets is an SPE, and\nthe holders of the legal or beneficial interests in the SPE have\nthe right to pledge or exchange such interests without restriction;\n(b) substantially all credit risks (and price risk, if any) associated\nwith the securitised assets have been transferred;\n(c) the originator has no direct or indirect control over the\nsecuritised assets;\n(d) the securitised assets are bankruptcy-remote from the originator;\n(e) the securitised assets held by the issuer cannot be consolidated\nwith the assets of the originator or the issuer’s parent in case of\nbankruptcy of any of them;\n(f) a qualified legal counsel (whether external or in-house) has\ngiven a written reasoned opinion that paragraphs (c) to (e) are\nsatisfied;\n(g) clean-up calls:\n(i) must be at the discretion of the issuer;\n(ii) must not provide credit enhancement; and\n(iii) may be exercised only when 10% or less of the purchase\nconsideration for the securitised assets remains to be paid;\nand\nNote A clean-up call is an option that permits the securitisation\nexposures to be called before all of the underlying exposures or\nsecuritisation exposures have been repaid.\npage 540 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nPart 4.3 Part 10.2\nRule 10.2.27\n(h) sukuk holders have a claim only on the securitised assets, and\nhave no claim against the originator.\nNote Under rule 10.4.1, an originator that meets the requirements set out in this\nrule must, however, hold regulatory capital against any exposures that it\nretains in relation to the securitisation (including exposures arising from\nthe provision of credit enhancements and liquidity facilities).\n10.2.27 Conditions for bankruptcy remoteness\n(1) The conditions for bankruptcy remoteness include those set out in\nsubrules (2) to (5).\n(2) If the issuer becomes bankrupt, the issuer’s assets are to be distributed\nin accordance with the law or a court order (rather than in accordance\nwith the contractual arrangements involving the issuer).\n(3) The transaction documents for the sale of the underlying assets to the\nsukuk holders must include:\n(a) separateness covenants to ensure:\n(i) bankruptcy remoteness of the issuer’s assets; and\n(ii) non-consolidation of the securitised assets held by the\nissuer with the assets of the originator or the issuer’s parent\nin case of bankruptcy of any of them;\n(b) non-competition declarations under which the investors and the\nissuer agree that neither will compete against the other in filing\nfor bankruptcy; and\n(c) bankruptcy declarations under which the originator, investors,\nproviders of credit enhancements, providers of liquidity\nfacilities and other parties agree not to initiate involuntary\nbankruptcy proceedings against the issuer.\n(4) The issuer must declare, in its constitutional documents and in the\ntransaction documents, not to initiate voluntary bankruptcy\nproceedings.\n(5) The covenants and declarations in this rule must be supported by a\nwritten and reasoned opinion of a qualified legal counsel.

This\nrequirement applies whether the exposure is on-balance-sheet or off-\nbalance-sheet.\n(3) Because payments of the principal and profits to sukuk holders\ndepend on the performance of the underlying assets, the firm must\nassess the performance of the sukuk on an ongoing basis.\nNote To properly assess the performance of sukuk, the firm must have on-going\nand timely access to performance information about the underlying\nassets. The information should include exposure type, percentage of\nfinancing 30, 60 and 90 days past due, default rates, prepayment rates,\nfinancings in foreclosure, property type, occupancy, average credit score,\nprogress of underlying project, average financing-to-value ratio, industry\ndiversification and geographic diversification.\n(4) The firm must, at all times, understand the sukuk’s structural features\nthat may materially affect the performance of its securitisation\nexposures (such as credit enhancements, liquidity facilities, triggers,\nand deal-specific definitions of default).\n(5) While the firm may rely on external credit risk assessments, it must\nensure that external assessments do not substitute for the firm’s own\ndue diligence and credit risk assessment.\nNote For the use of ECRAs:\n• generally, see Part 4.3\n• in relation to securitisations, see Division 10.2.E.\npage 542 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nPart 4.3 Part 10.2\nRule 10.2.29\n(6) If the firm fails to comply with this rule in relation to a securitisation\nexposure, the Regulatory Authority may direct the firm:\n(a) to apply a risk-weight of 1,250% to the exposure; or\n(b) to deduct the amount of the exposure from its regulatory capital.\n10.2.29 Capital treatment to be based on economic substance\n(1) The capital treatment of a securitisation exposure must be determined\non the basis of the economic substance, rather than the legal form, of\nthe securitisation structure.

The undertaking may be achieved by means of a\nparallel salam transaction in which a third party purchases the subject\nmatter for delivery on the same delivery date as in the original salam\ncontract.\n10.3.8 Treatment of salam sukuk without parallel salam\n(1) The risk-weight for salam sukuk without parallel salam must be based\non the counterparty (salam supplier) unless the salam capital is\nguaranteed by a third party.\n(2) If the salam capital is guaranteed by a third party, the risk-weight\nmust be based on the guarantor, but only if the guarantor’s risk-\nweight is lower than that of the salam supplier. The risk-weight for\nan unrated salam supplier or an unrated guarantor is 100%.\n(3) The market risk capital charge for salam sukuk without a parallel\nsalam contract or other hedge is 15% on the long position of salam\nexposures (that is, the charge for the underlying salam contract, as set\nout in rule 6.7.4).\n10.3.9 Treatment of salam sukuk with parallel salam\n(1) The risk-weight for salam sukuk with parallel salam must be based\non the counterparty (salam supplier) unless the salam capital is\nguaranteed by a third party.\n(2) If the salam capital is guaranteed by a third party, the risk-weight\nmust be based on the guarantor, but only if the guarantor’s risk-\nweight is lower than that of the salam supplier. The risk-weight for\nan unrated salam supplier or an unrated guarantor is 100%.\n(3) A salam sukuk issuance that is structured with an undertaking from\nthe issuer that the underlying commodity will be sold to a third party\nat a specified selling price (by means of a parallel salam contract)\nmust carry the risk-weight of the third party\n.\n(4) There is no capital charge for market risk that consists of basis and\nforward gap risks (namely, the risk that the hedge may be impaired\nbecause the underlying commodity delivered may be of inferior\nquality or may be delivered later than the contractual date). This is\npage 546 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nCapital requirements for holdings of sukuk Part 10.3\nRule 10.3.10\nbecause the underlying commodity is normally traded on an exchange\nthat eliminates the risk of late delivery, non-delivery or delivery of a\ncommodity that is of inferior quality.\n(5) The capital charge for salam sukuk with a parallel salam contract or\nother hedge is 15% on the net position of the salam exposures plus\n3% on the gross position of those exposures.\n10.3.10 Istisna sukuk\n(1) Istisna sukuk represent fractional shares in the financing of a project\nto construct an asset at a price to be paid in future instalments. The\ntotal of those instalments equals the face value of the sukuk plus mark-\nup.\n(2) The sukuk can be in the form of serial notes or certificates with\ndifferent maturity dates that match the progress schedule of\ninstalments as agreed between the sukuk issuer (as manager on behalf\nof the sukuk investors) and the construction firm.\n10.3.11 Treatment of istisna sukuk without parallel istisna\n(1) The risk-weight for istisna sukuk where there is no parallel istisna\nmust be based on the issuer.\n(2) If a third party provides a guarantee, the risk-weight for the istisna\nsukuk must be based on the guarantor, but only if the guarantor’s risk-\nweight is lower than that of the issuer. The risk-weight for an unrated\nissuer or an unrated guarantor is 100%.\n(3) To account for the price risk to which the underlying istisna is\nexposed, a risk-weight of 20% must be added in calculating the credit\nrisk capital charge.\n(4) A risk-weight of 400% applies if the returns to the sukuk holder come\nfrom the cash flow of the underlying asset (for example, a toll road or\nother infrastructure project).\n10.3.12 Treatment of istisna sukuk with parallel istisna\n(1) In the case of istisna sukuk with parallel istisna, the relevant asset\nmay be constructed on behalf of an ultimate counterparty or off-taker\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 547\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.3 Capital requirements for holdings of sukuk\nRule 10.3.13\nwith whom the Islamic banking business firm enters into the parallel\nistisna contract. In this case, there is a credit risk exposure to the\nultimate counterparty for the payment due under the parallel contract.\n(2) The credit risk starts at the commencement of the construction work\nuntil the whole amount or all the instalments are paid by the ultimate\ncounterparty.\n(3) The risk-weight for the credit exposure must be based on the ultimate\ncounterparty.\n(4) If a third party provides a guarantee, the risk-weight must be based\non the guarantor, but only if the guarantor’s risk-weight is lower than\nthat of the ultimate counterparty. The risk-weight for an unrated\ncustomer or an unrated guarantor is 100%.\n(5) A risk-weight of 400% applies if the returns to the sukuk holder come\nfrom the cash flow of the underlying asset (for example, a toll road or\nother infrastructure project).\n10.3.13 Murabahah sukuk\n(1) In murabahah sukuk, the originator (and, in some cases, the issuer) of\nthe sukuk is the buyer (on credit) of the murabahah asset and the\nsukuk investors are the sellers (on credit) of that asset. The funds\nprovided by the sukuk investors (and received by the issuer) represent\nthe murabahah selling price of the asset.\n(2) The sukuk holders own the murabahah and are entitled to receive\npayment of that receivable (the selling price of the asset) either in\ninstalments or in a lump sum at the end of the murabahah contract.\n10.3.14 Treatment of murabahah sukuk\n(1) The risk-weight for murabahah sukuk must be based on the issuer or\nother obligor (as rated by an ECRA). If the issuer or obligor is\nunrated, the risk-weight is 100%.\n(2) If the sukuk structure involves funding of an asset purchase in foreign\ncurrency, the relevant exposure must be calculated in accordance with\nPart 6.2 (foreign exchange risk).\npage 548 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nCapital requirements for holdings of sukuk Part 10.3\nRule 10.3.15\n10.3.15 Ijarah and IMB sukuk\n(1) Ijarah and IMB sukuk represent the holder’s proportionate ownership\nin leased assets where the sukuk holders collectively assume the rights\nand obligations of the lessor.

These sukuk entitle the holders to a\nreturn in proportion to their investment in the underlying assets and a\nright (under a purchase undertaking) to buy all or a proportion of the\nunderlying assets if specified conditions are fulfilled.\n(2) In wakalah sukuk, the SPE acting as the principal on behalf of the\nsukuk holders appoints a wakeel to invest funds provided by the sukuk\nholders into a pool of assets. The wakeel lends its expertise and\nmanages those investments on behalf of the SPE for a particular\nperiod, in order to generate a return for the sukuk investors.\n(3) The SPE and the wakeel enter into a wakalah agreement to govern\nthe appointment, scope of services and fees payable to the wakeel, if\nany.\n(4) The pool of assets may comprise a broad range of Shari’a-compliant\nassets that selected by the wakeel for a period corresponding to the\nduration of the sukuk (for example, Shari’a-compliant equities,\nShari’a-compliant assets such as real estate and cars, murabahah,\nistisna, other sukuk).\nNote While the wakalah structure has some similarities to the mudarabah\nstructure, the ways in which holders receive their share of profits differ:\n• wakalah sukuk holders receive the return on their investments less\nthe management fees payable to the wakeel\n• in a mudarabah structure, the profits are divided between the parties\naccording to agreed ratios.\n10.3.22 Treatment of wakalah sukuk\n(1) The treatment of wakalah sukuk must be based on the intent of the\nunderlying investments in wakalah as set out in this rule.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 551\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 10 Treatment of sukuk\nPart 10.3 Capital requirements for holdings of sukuk\nRule 10.3.22\n(2) For investments in trading activities in foreign exchange, shares or\ncommodities, the risk-weight must be as set out as set out in\nDivision 4.5.F (service-based contracts) and Chapter 6 (market risk).\n(3) For investments in assets that can be leased or sold on a murabahah\nbasis as income-producing wakalah investments with murabahah\nsubcontracts, the risk-weight must be based on the murabahah\nsubcontracts and the counterparties in those contracts.\n(4) For investments in assets that can be leased or sold on a murabahah\nbasis as income-producing wakalah investments through leasing to\nthird parties by means of ijarah, the risk-weight must be based on the\ncounterparty (that is, the lessee).\npage 552 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of sukuk Chapter 10\nCapital requirements where firm is originator or issuer Part 10.4\nRule 10.4.1\nPart 10.4 Capital requirements where firm\nis originator or issuer\n10.4.1 Retained securitisation exposures\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm that acts as originator of a sukuk\nissuance may, despite having transferred the underlying assets,\ncontinue to be exposed (through retained securitisation exposures)\nin relation to the securitisation.

An unrestricted PSIA is a\nPSIA for which the IAHs authorise the PSIA manager to invest the\nIAHs’ funds in a way that the manager considers appropriate, without\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 561\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 11 Treatment of PSIAs and associated risks\nPart 11.1 General\nRule 11.1.3\nany restriction as to where, how or for what purpose the funds may\nbe invested (provided that the investments are Shari’a-compliant).\n(3) A restricted PSIA is one where the IAHs authorise the firm to invest\nthe IAHs’ funds, with specified restrictions as to where, how and for\nwhat purpose the funds may be invested.\nNote 1 For the treatment of restricted PSIAs, see INMA, Chapter 9.\nNote 2 For guidance on the treatment of PSIAs as restricted or unrestricted, see\nparagraphs 12 and 13 of AAOIFI’s Statement of Concepts of Financial\nAccounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions.

The\nfirm must record all its transactions in investments for those accounts\nseparately.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 567\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 11 Treatment of PSIAs and associated risks\nPart 11.2 Rate of return and other risks\nRule 11.2.1\nPart 11.2 Rate of return and other risks\n11.2.1 Introduction\n(1) Rate of return risk (or ROR risk) is the risk that an increase in\nbenchmark rates may result in IAHs’ having expectations of a higher\nrate of return. It is the risk of facing a lower rate of return on assets\nthan currently expected by an Islamic banking business firm’s IAHs.\n(2) Rate of return risk may result in withdrawal risk and displaced\ncommercial risk. It can give rise to liquidity problems in the firm.\n(3) An Islamic banking business firm must manage the expectations of\nits shareholders and IAHs. If market rates of return of competitors’\nIAHs are higher than those of the firm’s IAHs, the firm must evaluate\nthe nature and extent of the expectations of its IAHs and assess the\namount of the gap between competitors’ rates and its own IAHs’\nexpected rates.\n11.2.2 Withdrawal risk and displaced commercial risk\n(1) Many Islamic banking business firms consider their IAHs as\nbehaving like conventional depositors who might withdraw their\nfunds in the case of lower-than-expected profit rates (withdrawal\nrisk). The withdrawal of funds by IAHs can expose a firm to liquidity\nrisk.\n(2) Another consequence of rate of return risk may be displaced\ncommercial risk (or DCR), which is the risk resulting from\ncompetitive pressures on a firm to attract and retain IAHs as fund\nproviders. The firm may be under market pressure to pay a return that\nexceeds the rate that has been earned on assets financed by IAHs\nwhen the return on those assets is under-performing compared with\ncompetitors’ rates.\nNote 1 For example, an Islamic banking business firm that acts as mudarib for\nan IAH may give up a part of its mudarib share or its profit to the IAH in\norder to smooth profit payouts. The risk of the firm being obliged to give\nup the share or profit for commercial or other reasons is a DCR.\npage 568 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of PSIAs and associated risks Chapter 11\nRate of return and other risks Part 11.2\nRule 11.2.3\nNote 2 The term ‘displaced’ is used because, initially, the risk from the volatility\nof returns is to be borne by the IAH as rabb-al-mal but that risk has been\ndisplaced onto the firm.\nNote 3 If a firm is able to manage the distribution of returns on PSIAs entirely\nthrough adjustments to its PER (that is, without having to give up part or\nall of its mudarib share of profits and without making any unilateral\ntransfer to IAHs from the shareholders’ current or retained profits), there\nis no DCR and there is no requirement for the firm to support an\nadditional capital charge for that risk.\n11.2.3 Role of governing body—rate of return risk\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm’s governing body must ensure that\nthe firm’s rate of return risk management policy:\n(a) gives the firm a comprehensive firm-wide view of the\nsignificant sources of rate of return risk; and\n(b) is consistent with the firm’s risk profile and systemic\nimportance.\n(2) The governing body must also ensure that the firm has adequate\npolicies and staff to identify, measure, evaluate, manage and control\nor mitigate its rate of return risk.\n(3) The governing body must approve the basis for computing the\namounts to be set aside by the firm for the PER or IRR.\n(4) The governing body must regularly review the firm’s investment\npolicies and the performance of the assets in which IAHs’ funds are\ninvested.\n11.2.4 Policies—rate of return risk\nAn Islamic banking business firm’s rate of return risk management\npolicy:\n(a) must describe the approach to managing the firm’s rate of return\nrisk and any resulting withdrawal risk or DCR;\n(b) must establish procedures to assess:\n(i) the contractual and behavioural maturity profiles of IAHs;\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 569\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 11 Treatment of PSIAs and associated risks\nPart 11.2 Rate of return and other risks\nRule 11.2.5\n(ii) the impacts of market factors affecting rates of return on\nassets in comparison with the expected rates of return for\nIAHs; and\n(iii) the effect of the level of the firm’s dependence on current\naccount holders’ funds;\nNote Although no returns are expected on current account\nholders’ funds, the sudden withdrawal of such funds would\nhave an adverse impact on the overall rate of return for the\nfirm.\n(c) must state the basis, and procedures, for any decision to give up\npart or all of its share of profits in favour of IAHs;\n(d) must set the firm’s risk appetite and tolerance for DCR; and\n(e) must include requirements for provisioning, and transfers to and\nfrom reserves, in accordance with the agreed contractual terms\nand conditions for IAHs.\n11.2.5 Smoothing techniques\n(1) To mitigate withdrawal risk and DCR, an Islamic banking business\nfirm may use one or more of the following techniques. The objective\nof smoothing techniques is to satisfy and retain fund providers and\ndissuade them from withdrawing their funds.\nGuidance\nEven before using smoothing techniques, an Islamic banking business firm is\nencouraged to employ balance sheet techniques to minimise its exposures to rate of\nreturn risk. Examples of the strategies that the firm might use include:\n• determining and varying future profit ratios according to expectations of\nmarket conditions\n• developing new Shari’a-compliant instruments\n• issuing securitisation tranches of Shari’a-permissible assets.\n(2) The firm may give up part or all of its mudarib share of profits. The\ndecision to give up part or all of its mudarib share of profits in favour\nof IAHs is a commercial decision.\n(3) The firm may make unilateral transfers (by means of hibah) to IAHs\nfrom the shareholders’ current or retained profits. Hibah is the\npage 570 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of PSIAs and associated risks Chapter 11\nRate of return and other risks Part 11.2\nRule 11.2.6\nunilateral transfer of ownership of a property or its benefit to another\nwithout any counter-value from the recipient.\n(4) The firm may establish a profit equalisation reserve (or PER) by\nsetting aside amounts from the investment profits, before allocating\nthe profit between the IAHs and the firm and before calculating its\nmudarib fees. The PER is to maintain a level of return on investment\nfor IAHs.\nGuidance\nAn Islamic banking business firm should develop and maintain an informed\njudgement about an appropriate level of the balances of its PER. The nature of the\nreserve implies that there will be years in which the balance of the reserve will be\nincreased, and others in which it will be depleted.\n(5) The firm may establish an investment risk reserve (or IRR) by setting\naside amounts from the investment profits of IAHs, after allocating\nPER (if any) and deducting the firm’s mudarib share of profits and\nfees. The IRR is to cushion against future investment losses for IAHs\nand must not be used for any other purpose.\n11.2.6 Calculating rate of return\n(1) An Islamic banking business firm must use the gapping method to\nallocate positions into time bands based on remaining maturities or\nrepricing dates.\n(2) Fixed-rate and floating-rate assets of the firm must be classified\naccording to their receivable dates because the returns on these\nreceivables represent the IAHs’ direct and beneficial ownership of the\nassets. Actual cash flows may indicate a gap for a particular time\nband, affecting the rate of return for that period.\n(3) Depending on the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s business,\nthe firm may employ techniques ranging from simple gap to advance\nsimulation or dynamic approaches to assess future cash flow\nvariability and net income.\nGuidance\n1 The estimates derived from selected approaches might provide acceptable\napproximations of periodic future earnings’ variability, and the outcomes\nwould yield different levels of expected returns to IAHs.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 571\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 11 Treatment of PSIAs and associated risks\nPart 11.2 Rate of return and other risks\nRule 11.2.7\n2 The measurement of rate of return risk highlights the importance of cash flow\nforecasting for instruments and contracts where the firm is required to simulate\nand assess their behavioural maturity, underlying assumptions and parameters,\nwhich should be reviewed periodically for reliability. The significance of\npotential threats to future earnings and the usefulness of the resulting\ninformation should be considered in determining the type and extent of\nforecasted behaviour for the firm.\n11.2.7 Relation to stress-testing\nWhen carrying out stress-testing or review of stress scenarios, an\nIslamic banking business firm must take into account the firm’s\nvulnerability to loss under adverse benchmark rate movements.\n11.2.8 Calculation of capital adequacy ratio—no smoothing\nIf an Islamic banking business firm does not smooth profit payouts to\nIAHs, the firm’s capital adequacy ratio is calculated by dividing the\nfirm’s regulatory capital by the amount calculated in accordance with\nthe following formula:\n(TRC + TRM + TRO) − (PRC + PRM)\nwhere:\nTRC is total risk-weighted assets adjusted for credit risk.\nTRM is total risk-weighted assets adjusted for market risk.\nTRO is total risk-weighted assets adjusted for operational risk.\nPRC is total risk-weighted assets financed by PSIAs, adjusted for\ncredit risk.\nPRM is total risk-weighted assets financed by PSIAs, adjusted for\nmarket risk.\nGuidance\nIf an Islamic banking business firm does not smooth profit payouts to IAHs, the\nfirm is not required to hold regulatory capital against credit or market risks arising\nfrom assets funded by the PSIAs. The RWAs funded by such accounts are excluded\nin respect of those risks in calculating the denominator of the firm’s CAR, leaving\nonly operational risk.\npage 572 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 V11\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nTreatment of PSIAs and associated risks Chapter 11\nRate of return and other risks Part 11.2\nRule 11.2.9\n11.2.9 Calculation of capital adequacy ratio—smoothing\nIf an Islamic banking business firm smooths profit payouts to IAHs,\nthe firm’s capital adequacy ratio is calculated by dividing the firm’s\nregulatory capital by the amount calculated in accordance with the\nfollowing formula:\n(TRC + TRM + TRO) (PRCR + PRMR) ((1 α) (PRCU +\nPRMU) α(PRCV + PRMV))\nwhere:\nα represents the proportion of assets funded by unrestricted PSIAs,\nand is set at 1 by the QFCRA.\nTRC is total risk-weighted assets adjusted for credit risk.\nTRM is total risk-weighted assets adjusted for market risk.\nTRO is total risk-weighted assets adjusted for operational risk.\nPRCR is total risk-weighted assets financed by restricted PSIAs,\nadjusted for credit risk.\nPRMR is total risk-weighted assets financed by restricted PSIAs,\nadjusted for market risk.\nPRCU is total risk-weighted assets financed by unrestricted PSIAs,\nadjusted for credit risk.\nPRMU is total risk-weighted assets financed by unrestricted PSIAs,\nadjusted for market risk.\nPRCV is total risk-weighted assets financed by the PER and IRR for\nunrestricted PSIAs, adjusted for credit risk.\nPRMV is total risk-weighted assets financed by the PER and IRR for\nunrestricted PSIAs, adjusted for market risk.\nGuidance\nIf an Islamic banking business firm smooths profit payouts to IAHs, the firm is\nrequired to hold regulatory capital against credit or market risks arising from assets\nfunded by the PSIAs, to cater for DCR. In this approach, credit and market risks of\nassets financed by unrestricted PSIAs are considered to be borne proportionately\nby both the IAHs and the firm. Therefore, a proportion of the RWAs funded by\nunrestricted PSIAs is required to be included in the denominator of the CAR.\nV11 Islamic Banking Business Prudential Rules 2015 page 573\nEffective:

General\n1.1.1 Introduction\n(1) These rules are the Investment Management and Advisory Rules 2014\n(or INMA).\n(2) These rules establish the prudential framework, and the framework\nfor client money and asset protection, for authorised firms to which,\nunder rule 1.1.4, these rules apply. Such an authorised firm is called\nan INMA firm in these rules.\n1.1.2 Commencement\nThese rules commence on 1 January 2015.\n1.1.3 Effect of definitions, notes and examples\n(1) A definition in the glossary to these rules also applies to any\ninstructions or document made under these rules.\n(2) A note in or to these rules is explanatory and is not part of these rules.\nHowever, examples and guidance are part of these rules.\n(3) An example is not exhaustive, and may extend, but does not limit, the\nmeaning of these rules or the particular provision of these rules to\nwhich it relates.\nNote Under FSR, article 17 (4), guidance is indicative of the view of the\nRegulatory Authority at the time and in the circumstances in which it was\ngiven.\n1.1.3A Declaration of activities as regulated activities\n(1) For FSR, article 23 (2), each of the following activities is a regulated\nactivity:\n(a) dealing (as agent) in Islamic investments;\nNote Buying, selling, subscribing for or underwriting any Islamic\ninvestment as principal is covered by IBANK.\n(b) arranging deals in Islamic investments;\nInvestment Management and Advisory Rules 2014\nV9 page 1\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nRule 1.1.4\n(c) arranging Shari’a-compliant financing facilities;\n(d) providing custody services in relation to Islamic investments;\n(e) arranging the provision of custody services in relation to Islamic\ninvestments;\n(f) managing Islamic investments;\n(g) advising on Islamic investments.\n(2) Islamic investments means investments through any 1 or more of the\nfollowing kinds of Islamic financial contracts mentioned in IBANK,\nrule 1.1.6 (b):\n(a) musharakah and its variations;\n(b) mudarabah and its variations;\n(c) any other Islamic financial contract that is recognised by the\nfirm’s Shari’a supervisory board.\n1.1.4 Application of these rules—general\nSubject to rule 1.1.5, these rules apply to an entity that has, or is\napplying for, an authorisation to conduct any of the following\nactivities:\n(a) dealing in investments (if limited to dealing as agent);\nNote Dealing in investments as principal is covered by BANK or\nIBANK, as applicable. Dealing in investments includes buying,\nselling, subscribing for or underwriting investment.\n(b) managing investments;\n(c) providing custody services;\n(d) operating a collective investment fund;\n(e) providing custody services in relation to a collective investment\nfund;\n(f) providing scheme administration;\nNote Providing scheme administration is defined in the Glossary.\n(g) arranging deals in investments;\nInvestment Management and Advisory Rules 2014\npage 2 V9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nGeneral Chapter 1\nRule 1.1.4\n(h) arranging the provision of custody services;\n(i) arranging financing facilities;\n(j) advising on investments.\nNote Each reference to investments in rule 1.1.4 includes Islamic\ninvestments—see the Glossary.\nGuidance\n1 The following Rules also apply to a firm to which these Rules apply:\n• if it is a banking business firm, within the meaning given by BANK—\nthose Rules\n• if it is an Islamic banking business firm, within the meaning given by\nIBANK—those Rules\n• if it is an Islamic financial institution (but not an Islamic banking\nbusiness firm)—CTRL, Chapter 9\n• in relation to its dealings with customers—CIPR\n• if it operates a collective investment scheme—COLL\n• if it operates a professional investor fund—PROF.\nRules that are of general application (CTRL, INDI, GENE, AML/CFTR and\nINAP) also apply.\n2 It is possible for a firm both to be authorised as a banking business firm under\nBANK (that is, as a deposit-taker or investment dealer) and to hold an\nauthorisation referred to in rule 1.1.4. Both these rules and BANK would apply\nto such a firm to some degree. Similarly, it is possible for a firm to be\nauthorised as an Islamic banking business firm under IBANK and to hold an\nauthorisation referred to in rule 1.1.4. (The firm’s authorisation would include\na condition that the whole of its business must be conducted in accordance\nwith Shari’a.) Both these rules and IBANK would apply to such a firm to some\ndegree. (It is not possible for a firm to be authorised under both BANK and\nIBANK because Islamic windows are not permitted.)\n3 For example, a banking business firm that also holds an authorisation referred\nto in rule 1.1.4 will need to comply with these rules, except as follows:\n• Part 3.3 (Minimum capital and liquid assets requirements) does not\napply because compliance with the capital adequacy and liquidity\nrequirements in BANK or IBANK (as applicable) is taken to be\ncompliance with Part 3.3.\n• Part 4.3 (Professional indemnity insurance) would not apply because the\nRegulatory Authority considers it unnecessary for a firm that is also\nInvestment Management and Advisory Rules 2014\nV9 page 3\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 1 General\nRule 1.1.5\nauthorised as a banking business firm or an Islamic banking business\nfirm.\n1.1.5 Interaction between these rules and IMEB\nIf an authorised firm holds both an authorisation referred to in\nrule 1.1.4 and an authorisation for insurance mediation (within the\nmeaning given by IMEB, rule 1.2.2), these rules and IMEB each apply\nto the firm to the extent that the Regulatory Authority directs.\n1.1.6 Application of these rules—branches\nThese rules apply to a branch that has an authorisation to conduct an\nactivity mentioned in rule 1.1.4, except to the extent stated otherwise.\nGuidance\nThe requirements of these rules about financial resources do not apply to branches\n(see rule 3.3.1), but branches are subject to particular obligations to supply\ninformation to the Regulatory Authority (see rule 2.1.7).\n1.1.7 Requirement for policy also requires procedures and\nsystems\nIn these rules, a requirement for an INMA firm to have a policy also\nrequires such a firm to have the procedures, systems, processes,\ncontrols and limits needed to give effect to the policy.\n1.1.8 Legal form that firms must take\nAn INMA firm may be:\n(a) a limited liability company incorporated under the Companies\nRegulations 2005;\n(b) a limited liability partnership incorporated under the Limited\nLiability Partnerships Regulations 2005; or\n(c) a branch registered with the QFC Companies Registration\nOffice.\nNote Branch is defined in the glossary.\nInvestment Management and Advisory Rules 2014\npage 4 V9\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nPrudential reporting requirements Chapter 2\nRule 2.1.1\nChapter 2 Prudential reporting\nrequirements\n2.1.1 Introduction\n(1) This Chapter sets out the prudential reporting requirements for an\nINMA firm.\n(2) Prudential returns of an INMA firm must reflect the firm’s\nmanagement accounts, financial statements and ancillary reports. An\nINMA firm’s returns, accounts, statements and reports must all be\nprepared using the same standards and practices, and must be easily\nreconcilable with one another.\n2.1.2 Preparing returns\n(1) An INMA firm must prepare the prudential returns that it is required\nto prepare by notice published by the Regulatory Authority on an\napproved website. Such a notice may also require INMA firms to give\nother information to the authority.\n(2) The firm must give the return to the Regulatory Authority within the\nperiod stated in the relevant notice.\n(3) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice:\n(a) require a firm to prepare additional prudential returns;\n(b) exempt a firm from a requirement to prepare annual, biannual,\nquarterly or monthly returns (or a particular return); or\n(c) extend the period within which to give a return.\n(4) An exemption may be subject to 1 or more conditions. The firm must\ncomply with any condition attached to an exemption.\n(5) The firm must prepare and give prudential returns in accordance with\nthe Regulatory Authority’s instructions. The instructions may require\nthat the return be prepared or given through the authority’s electronic\nsubmission system.\nInvestment Management and Advisory Rules 2014\nV9 page 5\nEffective: 1/Oct/25\n\nChapter 2 Prudential reporting requirements\nRule 2.1.3\n(6) The instructions may be set out in these rules, in the return itself, in a\nseparate document published by the authority on an approved website\nor by written notice. These instructions, wherever or however they\nare given, are collectively referred to as instructions for preparing\nreturns.\nNote Instructions might be in the form of formulae or blank spaces that the\nfirm must use or fill in and that automatically compute the amounts to be\nreported.\n2.1.3 Giving information\n(1) The Regulatory Authority may, by written notice, require an INMA\nfirm to give it information additional to that required by these rules.\n(2) An INMA firm must give information to the authority in accordance\nwith the authority’s instructions and within the period stated in the\nnotice.

However, examples and guidance are part of these Rules.\n(3) An example is not exhaustive, and may extend, but does not limit, the\nmeaning of these Rules or the particular provision of these Rules to\nwhich it relates.\nNote Under FSR, article 17 (4), guidance is indicative of the view of the\nRegulatory Authority at the time and in the circumstances in which it was\ngiven.\nV1 Investment Token Rules 2024 page 3\nEffective: 1/Sep/24\n\nChapter 2 Regulated Activities involving investment tokens\nChapter 2 Regulated Activities involving\ninvestment tokens\n2.1.1 Investment tokens\n(1) Investment token means a token which falls within subrule (2) (but\nsee rule 2.1.3 (1) (b)).\n(2) A token representing a right mentioned in subrule (3) represents that\nright for the purposes of the FSR and any other relevant Regulations\nand Rules and any such Regulations and Rules apply to the token as\nif it were that right.\nNote 1 Consequently:\n• activity carried on in relation to an investment token is a regulated\nactivity if it would be a regulated activity were it to be carried on in\nrelation to the right in question (but see the prohibition of activity in\nrelation to certain tokens in rule 2.1.2 and the power of the\nRegulatory Authority to prohibit other activity in relation to\ninvestment tokens under rule 2.1.3 (1) (a)); and\n• if an investment token represents an investment within the meaning\ngiven by Article 110 of the FSR it is treated as being an investment\nfor the purposes of the FSR and any other relevant Regulations and\nRules.\nNote 2 If an investment token is a permitted token, the ownership and transfer of\nthe token and the right it represents is governed by the Digital Asset\nRegulations 2024. If an investment token is subject to the law of another\njurisdiction (for example, because the token is generated in another\njurisdiction) the ownership and transfer of the token and the right it\nrepresents will be governed by the applicable law of that jurisdiction.\n(3) The rights referred to in subrule (2) are:\n(a) rights in a specified product;\n(b) rights in an approved derivative within the meaning of rule 1.2.1\nof the Derivatives Markets and Exchanges Rules 2023, that is\nnot itself a specified product;\npage 4 Investment Token Rules 2024 V1\nEffective: 1/Sep/24\n\nRegulated Activities involving investment tokens Chapter 2\n(c) rights in or derived from an Islamic financial contract mentioned\nin rule 1.1.5 (b) or 1.1.6 (1) (b) of the Islamic Banking Business\nPrudential Rules 2015;\n(d) any right that:\n(i) is substantially similar in nature to; or\n(ii) has a substantially similar purpose or effect as,\na right mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (c).\n2.1.2 Prohibiting activity in relation to certain tokens\nNo activity may be carried on in or from the QFC in relation to a\ntoken that:\n(a) does not represent a right in any property (other than the token\nitself); or\n(b) is a substitute for, or represents, currency, or can otherwise be\nused as a means of payment.\nNote A token such as is mentioned in this rule is also an excluded token by\nvirtue of the Digital Asset Regulations 2024. Excluded tokens may not\nbe generated in the QFC by token generators licensed by the QFC\nAuthority.\nExamples\nA cryptocurrency token that is used as an alternative to fiat currencies but is\nnot issued or backed by any governmental authority and does not represent any\n‘off-chain’ property, is an example of an excluded token.\nA token commonly referred to as a stablecoin is an example of an excluded\ntoken. This is because a stablecoin is regarded as a substitute for currency that\ncan be used as a means of payment.\nHowever, a token representing a right to a commodity, such as a precious metal,\nis not an excluded token even though it may be tradeable.\nV1 Investment Token Rules 2024 page 5\nEffective: 1/Sep/24\n\nChapter 2 Regulated Activities involving investment tokens\n2.1.3 Power to prohibit certain activities and to designate\ntokens as excluded tokens\n(1) The Regulatory Authority may, by notice published on an approved\nwebsite:\n(a) designate that an activity carried on in relation to an investment\ntoken, or category of investment tokens, may not be carried on\nin or from the QFC; and\n(b) designate tokens representing a right, or category of rights,\nmentioned in rule 2.1.1 (3) as excluded tokens.\nNote 1 An excluded token is not a permitted token and therefore a right\ndesignated in a notice under this rule may not be tokenised in the QFC.\nNote 2 For the meaning of approved website, see the Interpretation and\nApplication Rules 2005, rule 3.1.2.\n(2) The Authority may amend, withdraw or substitute a notice.\n2.1.4 Declaration of regulated activities of operating an\ninvestment token exchange and clearing and settling\ntransactions\n(1) For FSR, article 23 (2), the following activities are regulated\nactivities:\n(a) operating an investment token exchange; and\n(b) clearing and settling transactions in investment tokens by way\nof business.\n(2) A firm operates an investment token exchange if the firm, by way of\nbusiness, operates a system which brings together multiple third party\nbuying and selling interests in investment tokens, in accordance with\nthe system’s non-discretionary rules, in a way that results in a contract\nin respect of such investment tokens.\n(3) A firm does not carry on the regulated activity of operating an\ninvestment token exchange if it operates a facility which is merely an\norder-routing system where buying and selling interests in, or orders\nfor, investment tokens are merely transmitted but do not interact.\npage 6 Investment Token Rules 2024 V1\nEffective: 1/Sep/24\n\nRegulated Activities involving investment tokens Chapter 2\n(4) This rule applies only in relation to an investment token that:\n(a) is a permitted token;

or\n(b) it is treated as holding or controlling them by virtue of subrule\n(3).\n(3) A firm which holds or controls the means by which its clients’\ninvestment tokens may be recorded and transacted on token\ninfrastructure is treated as holding or controlling investment tokens.\nExample\nA company that holds or safeguards the private keys for its clients’ investment\ntokens is providing custody services in relation to those tokens and consequently in\nrelation to the rights represented by those tokens.\n(4) For FSR, article 23 (2), arranging the provision of a service referred\nto in subrule (3) by way of business constitutes the regulated activity\nof arranging the provision of custody services.\nV1 Investment Token Rules 2024 page 7\nEffective: 1/Sep/24\n\nChapter 2 Regulated Activities involving investment tokens\n(5) Whether a service is provided by way of business is determined by\nFSR, article 25 and any Rules made under that article.\nNote See INMA Chapter 6 for detailed provisions applying to firms providing\ncustody services.\npage 8 Investment Token Rules 2024 V1\nEffective: 1/Sep/24\n\nGlossary\nGlossary\n(see r 1.1.3)\ndistributed ledger technology means a technology that enables the\noperation and use of distributed ledgers, and for this definition:\n(a) distributed ledger means an information repository that keeps\nrecords of transactions and that is shared across, and\nsynchronised between, a set of distributed network nodes using\na consensus mechanism;
