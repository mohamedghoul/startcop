# New Application Page - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete multi-step form for creating new compliance evaluation applications. The implementation follows the specification in `documentation/New_application_page.yaml`.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Step Form with Stepper
- **Location**: `src/components/ui/stepper.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Visual progress indicator
  - Step completion tracking
  - Responsive design (horizontal on large screens, vertical on small screens)
  - Accessible with ARIA labels and roles

### 2. File Upload with Dropzone
- **Location**: `src/components/ui/file-dropzone.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop file upload
  - File type validation (PDF and DOCX only)
  - File size validation (25 MB max)
  - Max files limit (10 files)
  - Upload progress tracking for each file
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Keyboard accessible
  - ARIA-described for screen readers

### 3. Multi-Select for Frameworks
- **Location**: `src/components/ui/multi-select.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Searchable dropdown
  - Multiple selection with visual tags
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Click-outside to close
  - Remove individual selections

### 4. Progress Tracking
- **Location**: `src/components/ui/progress.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Visual progress bar
  - ARIA-valuenow for accessibility
  - Used in file uploads and evaluation progress

### 5. Main Application Page
- **Location**: `src/pages/NewApplication.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Three-step form process:
    1. Upload documents
    2. Select regulatory frameworks
    3. Review and start evaluation
  - Breadcrumb navigation
  - Form validation at each step
  - Progress modal during evaluation
  - Toast notifications for errors and success
  - Responsive layout

### 6. Dashboard
- **Location**: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Overview of applications
  - Statistics cards
  - Recent applications list
  - Quick action to create new application

## Routing

The application uses React Router with the following routes:
- `/` - Redirects to `/dashboard`
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard view
- `/new` - New Application form

## Accessibility (A11y)

All components follow accessibility best practices:
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Focus management
- Progress indicators with aria-valuenow

## Validation

Form validation is implemented at each step:
- **Step 1 (Upload Documents)**: Requires at least one successfully uploaded file
- **Step 2 (Select Frameworks)**: Requires at least one framework to be selected
- **Step 3 (Initiate Evaluation)**: Reviews all requirements before submission

Error messages match the specification:
- "Only PDF or DOCX are supported." - for invalid file types
- "Each file must be ≤ 25 MB." - for oversized files
- "Select at least one framework." - when no frameworks are selected

## Mock Data

Currently using mock data for:
- Framework options (QFCRA, AML/KYC, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, NIST)
- Dashboard statistics
- Recent applications

## API Integration Points

The implementation is ready for API integration at these points:

1. **File Upload**: `POST /api/apps/:id/files`
   - Currently simulated with progress animation
   - File validation happens client-side

2. **List Frameworks**: `GET /api/frameworks`
   - Currently using mock data in `FRAMEWORKS` constant
   - Should be replaced with actual API call

3. **Start Evaluation**: `POST /api/apps/:id/evaluate`
   - Currently simulated with progress animation
   - Should trigger actual backend evaluation

4. **Cancel Evaluation**: `POST /api/apps/:id/evaluate/cancel`
   - Not yet implemented (requires backend support)

## Responsiveness

The implementation is fully responsive:
- Stepper switches between horizontal (desktop) and vertical (mobile) layouts
- Cards and forms adapt to screen size
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

## Security Considerations

As per specification:
- File type validation on client-side (server-side validation should be added)
- File size restrictions enforced
- MIME type checking for uploads
- Note: Server-side antivirus scanning and PII redaction should be implemented on the backend

## Technologies Used

- **React 19**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **React Router DOM**: Client-side routing
- **React Dropzone**: File upload handling
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management (ready for use)
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives

2. Upload PDF or DOCX files (drag-and-drop or click to select)
3. Try uploading invalid file types to see error handling
4. Select one or more regulatory frameworks
5. Review your selections and start evaluation
6. Watch the progress modal during evaluation
7. Navigate back to dashboard after completion
